  "IssueID": 10328,
  "VulnerabilityID": "CVE-2019-11234",
  "Release": "3.6",
  "Package": "freeradius",
  "Repository": "main",
  "FixedVersion": "3.0.13-r3",
  "Subject": "[3.6] freeradius: Multiple vulnerabilities (CVE-2019-11234, CVE-2019-11235)",
  "Description": "h2. CVE-2019-11234: eap-pwd: fake authentication using reflection \r\n\r\nA vulnerability was found in FreeRadius. An attacker can reflect the received scalar and element from the server in it's own commit message, and subsequently reflect the confirm value as well. This causes \r\nthe adversary to successfully authenticate as the victim. Fortunately, the adversary will not posses the negotiated session key, meaning the adversary cannot actually perform any actions as this user.\r\n\r\nh3. Affected Versions:\r\n\r\nfreeradius 3.0.0 through 3.0.18\r\n\r\nh3. Fixed In Version:\t\r\n\r\nfreeradius 3.0.19\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\nhttps://freeradius.org/security/\r\nhttps://freeradius.org/release_notes/?br=3.0.x\u0026re=3.0.19\r\n\r\nPatches:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/85497b5ff37ccb656895b826b88585898c209586\r\nhttps://github.com/FreeRADIUS/freeradius-server/commit/ab4c767099f263a7cd4109bcdca80ee74210a769\r\n\r\nh2. CVE-2019-11235: eap-pwd: authentication bypass via an invalid curve attack\r\n\r\nA vulnerability was found in FreeRadius. An invalid curve attack allows an attacker to authenticate as any user (without knowing the password). The problem is \r\nthat on the reception of an EAP-PWD Commit frame, FreeRADIUS doesn't verify whether the received elliptic curve point is valid.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Fixed In Version:\t\r\n\r\nfreeradius 3.0.19\t\r\n\r\nh3. References:\r\n\r\nhttps://freeradius.org/security/\r\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-11235\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.
