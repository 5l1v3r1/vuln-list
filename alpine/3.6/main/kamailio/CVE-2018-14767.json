  "Subject": "[3.6] kamailio: Security vulnerability in Kamailio core related to To header processing (CVE-2018-14767)",
  "Description": "In Kamailio before 5.0.7 and 5.1.x before 5.1.4, a crafted SIP message with a double \"To\" header and an empty \"To\" tag causes \r\na segmentation fault and crash. The reason is missing input validation in the \"build_res_buf_from_sip_req\" core function. \r\nThis could result in denial of service and potentially the execution of arbitrary code.\r\n\r\nh3.
