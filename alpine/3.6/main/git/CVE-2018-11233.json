  "IssueID": 8948,
  "VulnerabilityID": "CVE-2018-11233",
  "Release": "3.6",
  "Package": "git",
  "Repository": "main",
  "FixedVersion": "2.13.7-r0",
  "Subject": "[3.6] git: Multiple vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-11233, CVE-2018-11235)",
  "Description": "h3. CVE-2018-11233: \r\n\r\nIn Git before 2.13.7, 2.14.x before 2.14.4, 2.15.x before 2.15.2, 2.16.x before 2.16.4, and 2.17.x before 2.17.1, \r\ncode to sanity-check pathnames on NTFS can result in reading out-of-bounds memory.\r\n\r\nh3. References:\r\n\r\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-11233\r\nhttps://marc.info/?l=git\u0026m=152761328506724\u0026w=2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. CVE-2018-11235:\r\n\r\nIn Git before 2.13.7, 2.14.x before 2.14.4, 2.15.x before 2.15.2, 2.16.x before 2.16.4, and 2.17.x before 2.17.1, remote code execution can occur. With a crafted .gitmodules file, a malicious project can execute an arbitrary script on a machine that runs \"git clone --recurse-submodules\" because submodule \"names\" are obtained from this file, and then appended to $GIT_DIR/modules, leading to directory traversal with \"../\" in a name. Finally, post-checkout hooks from a submodule are executed, bypassing the intended design in which hooks are not obtained from a remote server.\r\n\r\nh3.
