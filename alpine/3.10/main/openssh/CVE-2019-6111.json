  "IssueID": 9996,
  "VulnerabilityID": "CVE-2019-6111",
  "Release": "3.10",
  "Package": "openssh",
  "Repository": "main",
  "FixedVersion": "7.9_p1-r3",
  "Subject": "[3.10] openssh: Multiple vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-20685, CVE-2019-6109, CVE-2019-6111)",
  "Description": "*CVE-2018-20685*: In OpenSSH 7.9, scp.c in the scp client allows remote SSH servers to bypass intended access restrictions via the \r\nfilename of . or an empty filename. The impact is modifying the permissions of the target directory on the client side.\r\n\r\nh3. References:\r\n\r\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-20685\r\nhttps://marc.info/?l=oss-security\u0026m=154745764812881\u0026w=2\r\n\r\nh3. Patch:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/commit/6010c0303a422a9c5fa8860c061bf7105eb7f8b2\r\n\r\n*CVE-2019-6109*: An issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to missing character encoding in the progress display, a malicious server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can employ crafted object names to manipulate the client output, e.g., by using ANSI control codes to hide additional files being transferred. This affects refresh_progress_meter() in progressmeter.c.\r\n\r\nh3.

Patch:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/commit/8976f1c4b2721c26e878151f52bdf346dfe2d54c\r\npossibly additionally needed: https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/commit/bdc6c63c80b55bcbaa66b5fde31c1cb1d09a41eb\r\n\r\n*CVE-2019-6111*: An issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to the scp implementation being derived from 1983 rcp, the server chooses which files/directories are sent to the client. However, the scp client only performs cursory validation of the object name returned (only directory traversal attacks are prevented). A malicious scp server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary files in the scp client target directory. If recursive operation (-r) is performed, the server can manipulate subdirectories as well (for example, to overwrite the .ssh/authorized_keys file).\r\n\r\nh3.
