  "Release": "3.0",
  "Package": "php",
  "Repository": "main",
  "FixedVersion": "5.5.26-r0",
  "Subject": "[v3.0] php: multiple issues (CVE-2015-4021, CVE-2015-4022, CVE-2015-4024, CVE-2015-4025, CVE-2015-4026)",
  "Description": "CVE-2015-4021\r\nThe phar_parse_tarfile function in ext/phar/tar.c in PHP before 5.4.41, 5.5.x before 5.5.25, and 5.6.x before 5.6.9 does not verify that the first character of a filename is different from the \\0 character, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (integer underflow and memory corruption) via a crafted entry in a tar archive.\r\n\r\nCVE-2015-4022\r\nInteger overflow in the ftp_genlist function in ext/ftp/ftp.c in PHP before 5.4.41, 5.5.x before 5.5.25, and 5.6.x before 5.6.9 allows remote FTP servers to execute arbitrary code via a long reply to a LIST command, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.\r\n\r\nCVE-2015-4024\r\nAlgorithmic complexity vulnerability in the multipart_buffer_headers function in main/rfc1867.c in PHP before 5.4.41, 5.5.x before 5.5.25, and 5.6.x before 5.6.9 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted form data that triggers an improper order-of-growth outcome.\r\n\r\nCVE-2015-4025\r\nPHP before 5.4.41, 5.5.x before 5.5.25, and 5.6.x before 5.6.9 truncates a pathname upon encountering a \\x00 character in certain situations, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended extension restrictions and access files or directories with unexpected names via a crafted argument to (1) set_include_path, (2) tempnam, (3) rmdir, or (4) readlink. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2006-7243.\r\n\r\nCVE-2015-4026\r\nThe pcntl_exec implementation in PHP before 5.4.41, 5.5.x before 5.5.25, and 5.6.x before 5.6.9 truncates a pathname upon encountering a \\x00 character, which might allow remote attackers to bypass intended extension restrictions and execute files with unexpected names via a crafted first argument. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2006-7243.\r\n"
