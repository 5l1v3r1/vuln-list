  "Subject": "[v3.0] gnutls: double free in certificate DN decoding (CVE-2015-6251)",
  "Description": "Double free vulnerability in GnuTLS before 3.3.17 and 3.4.x before 3.4.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a long DistinguishedName (DN) entry in a certificate. \r\nDecoding a specific certificate with very long DistinguishedName (DN) entries leads to double free, which may\r\nresult to a denial of service. Since the DN decoding occurs in almost all applications using certificates it is recommended to upgrade the\r\nlatest GnuTLS version fixing the issue. Recommendation: Upgrade to GnuTLS 3.4.4, or 3.3.17.\"\r\n\r\nThe upstream patch that fixes this issue is available at:\r\nhttps://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/commit/272854367efc130fbd4f1a51840d80c630214e12\r\n\r\nlib/x509/common.c\r\n_gnutls_x509_dn_to_string\r\n+  str-\u003edata = NULL;\r\n\r\nReference:\r\n\u003e http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q3/374\r\n\u003e http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-6251"
