A remote attacker can take advantage\r\n of this flaw to cause a denial of service (application crash).\r\n\r\nUse *CVE-2015-8472* for this remaining problem that existed in 1.6.19\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Fixed in 1.6.20\r\n\r\nh3. References:\r\n\r\nhttps://marc.info/?l=oss-security\u0026m=144929077710907\u0026w=2\r\nhttps://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2015-8472\r\n"
