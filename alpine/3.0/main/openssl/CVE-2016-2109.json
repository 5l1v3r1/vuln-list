  "Subject": "[3.0] openssl: Multiple vulnerabilities (CVE-2016-2105, CVE-2016-2106, CVE-2016-2107, CVE-2016-2109,  CVE-2016-2176)",
  "Description": "h3. CVE-2016-2105:\r\n\r\nAn overflow can occur in the EVP_EncodeUpdate() function which is used for Base64 encoding of binary data. If an attacker is able \r\nto supply very large amounts of input data then a length check can overflow resulting in a heap corruption. Internally to OpenSSL the\r\nEVP_EncodeUpdate() function is primarly used by the PEM_write_bio* family of functions.\r\n\r\nFixed in OpenSSL *1.0.1t* (Affected *1.0.1s*, 1.0.1r, 1.0.1q, 1.0.1p, 1.0.1o, 1.0.1n, 1.0.1m, 1.0.1l, 1.0.1k, 1.0.1j, 1.0.1i, 1.0.1h, 1.0.1g, 1.0.1f, 1.0.1e, 1.0.1d, 1.0.1c, 1.0.1b, 1.0.1a, 1.0.1)\r\n\r\nFixed in OpenSSL *1.0.2h* (Affected *1.0.2g*, 1.0.2f, 1.0.2e, 1.0.2d, 1.0.2c, 1.0.2b, 1.0.2a, 1.0.2)\r\n\r\nh3. CVE-2016-2106:\r\n\r\nAn overflow can occur in the EVP_EncryptUpdate() function. If an attacker is able to supply very large amounts of input data after a\r\nprevious call to EVP_EncryptUpdate() with a partial block then a length check can overflow resulting in a heap corruption. \r\n\r\nFixed in OpenSSL *1.0.1t* (Affected *1.0.1s*, 1.0.1r, 1.0.1q, 1.0.1p, 1.0.1o, 1.0.1n, 1.0.1m, 1.0.1l, 1.0.1k, 1.0.1j, 1.0.1i, 1.0.1h, 1.0.1g, 1.0.1f, 1.0.1e, 1.0.1d, 1.0.1c, 1.0.1b, 1.0.1a, 1.0.1)\r\n\r\nFixed in OpenSSL *1.0.2h* (Affected *1.0.2g*, 1.0.2f, 1.0.2e, 1.0.2d, 1.0.2c, 1.0.2b, 1.0.2a, 1.0.2)\r\n\r\nh3.
