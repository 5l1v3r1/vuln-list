  "Description": "h3. CVE-2016-0702: \r\n\r\nA side-channel attack was found which makes use of cache-bank conflicts\r\non the Intel Sandy-Bridge microarchitecture which could lead to the recovery of RSA keys.\r\nThe ability to exploit this issue is limited as it relies on an attacker who has control \r\nof code in a thread running on the same hyper-threaded core as the victim thread which is performing decryptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.1s* (*Affected 1.0.1r*, 1.0.1q, 1.0.1p, 1.0.1o, 1.0.1n, 1.0.1m, 1.0.1l,\r\n1.0.1k, 1.0.1j, 1.0.1i, 1.0.1h, 1.0.1g, 1.0.1f, 1.0.1e, 1.0.1d, 1.0.1c, 1.0.1b, 1.0.1a, 1.0.1)\r\n\r\n*Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2g* (*Affected 1.0.2f*, 1.0.2e, 1.0.2d, 1.0.2c, 1.0.2b, 1.0.2a, 1.0.2)\r\n\r\nh3. CVE-2016-0799:\r\n\r\nThe internal |fmtstr| function used in processing a \"%s\" format string in the\r\nBIO_*printf functions could overflow while calculating the length of a string and cause an OOB \r\nread when printing very long strings.\r\n\r\n\r\n*\r\nFixed in OpenSSL 1.0.1s* (*Affected 1.0.1r*, 1.0.1q, 1.0.1p, 1.0.1o, 1.0.1n, 1.0.1m, 1.0.1l, 1.0.1k, 1.0.1j,\r\n1.0.1i, 1.0.1h, 1.0.1g, 1.0.1f, 1.0.1e, 1.0.1d, 1.0.1c, 1.0.1b, 1.0.1a, 1.0.1)\r\n\r\nFixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2g (*Affected 1.0.2f*, 1.0.2e, 1.0.2d, 1.0.2c, 1.0.2b, 1.0.2a, 1.0.2)\r\n\r\nh3. CVE-2016-0797: \r\n\r\nIn the BN_hex2bn function the number of hex digits is calculated using an int value |i|. \r\nLater |bn_expand| is called with a value of |i * 4|. For large values of |i| this can result in |bn_expand| \r\nnot allocating any memory because |i * 4| is negative. \r\n\r\n*\r\nFixed in OpenSSL 1.0.1s* (*Affected 1.0.1r*, 1.0.1q, 1.0.1p, 1.0.1o, 1.0.1n, 1.0.1m, 1.0.1l, 1.0.1k, 1.0.1j, \r\n1.0.1i, 1.0.1h, 1.0.1g, 1.0.1f, 1.0.1e, 1.0.1d, 1.0.1c, 1.0.1b, 1.0.1a, 1.0.1)\r\n\r\n*Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2g* (*Affected 1.0.2f*, 1.0.2e, 1.0.2d, 1.0.2c, 1.0.2b, 1.0.2a, 1.0.2)\r\n\r\nh3. CVE-2016-0798:\r\n\r\nThe SRP user database lookup method SRP_VBASE_get_by_user had confusing memory management semantics; \r\nthe returned pointer was sometimes newly allocated, and sometimes owned by the callee. The calling code has no way \r\nof distinguishing these two cases. Specifically, SRP servers that configure a secret seed to hide valid login \r\ninformation are vulnerable to a memory leak: an attacker connecting with an invalid username can cause a memory \r\nleak of around 300 bytes per connection. \r\n\r\n*Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.1s* (*Affected 1.0.1r*, 1.0.1q, 1.0.1p, 1.0.1o, 1.0.1n, 1.0.1m, 1.0.1l, 1.0.1k, 1.0.1j, \r\n1.0.1i, 1.0.1h, 1.0.1g, 1.0.1f, 1.0.1e, 1.0.1d, 1.0.1c, 1.0.1b, 1.0.1a, 1.0.1)\r\n\r\n*Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2g* (*Affected 1.0.2f*, 1.0.2e, 1.0.2d, 1.0.2c, 1.0.2b, 1.0.2a, 1.0.2)\r\n\r\nh3. CVE-2016-0705: \r\n\r\nA double free bug was discovered when OpenSSL parses malformed DSA private keys and could lead to a DoS\r\nattack or memory corruption for applications that receive DSA private keys from untrusted sources.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.1s* (*Affected 1.0.1r*, 1.0.1q, 1.0.1p, 1.0.1o, 1.0.1n, 1.0.1m, 1.0.1l, 1.0.1k, 1.0.1j, \r\n1.0.1i, 1.0.1h, 1.0.1g, 1.0.1f, 1.0.1e, 1.0.1d, 1.0.1c, 1.0.1b, 1.0.1a, 1.0.1)\r\n\r\n*Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2g* (*Affected 1.0.2f*, 1.0.2e, 1.0.2d, 1.0.2c, 1.0.2b, 1.0.2a, 1.0.2)\r\n\r\nh3. CVE-2016-0800:\r\n\r\nA cross-protocol attack was discovered that could lead to decryption of TLS sessions by using \r\na server supporting SSLv2 and EXPORT cipher suites as a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle. \r\nNote that traffic between clients and non-vulnerable servers can be decrypted provided another server \r\nsupporting SSLv2 and EXPORT ciphers (even with a different protocol such as SMTP, IMAP or POP) shares the \r\nRSA keys of the non-vulnerable server. \r\n\r\n\r\n*Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.1s* (*Affected 1.0.1r*, 1.0.1q, 1.0.1p, 1.0.1o, 1.0.1n, 1.0.1m, 1.0.1l, 1.0.1k, 1.0.1j, \r\n1.0.1i, 1.0.1h, 1.0.1g, 1.0.1f, 1.0.1e, 1.0.1d, 1.0.1c, 1.0.1b, 1.0.1a, 1.0.1)\r\n\r\n*Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2g* (*Affected 1.0.2f*, 1.0.2e, 1.0.2d, 1.0.2c, 1.0.2b, 1.0.2a, 1.0.2)\r\n\r\nh3.
