  "Subject": "[v3.0] qemu: heap overflow flaw while processing certain ATAPI commands (CVE-2015-5154)",
  "Description": "The QEMU security team has predisclosed the following advisory:\r\nA heap overflow flaw was found in the way QEMU's IDE subsystem\r\n    handled I/O buffer access while processing certain ATAPI commands.\r\nA privileged guest user in a guest with CDROM drive enabled could\r\n    potentially use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the host\r\n    with the privileges of the host's QEMU process corresponding to\r\n    the guest.\r\n\r\nIMPACT ======\r\n\r\nAn HVM guest which has access to an emulated IDE CDROM device\r\n(e.g. with a device with \"devtype=cdrom\", or the \"cdrom\" convenience\r\nalias, in the VBD configuration) can exploit this vulnerability to\r\ntake over the qemu process elevating its privilege to that of the qemu\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nVULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================\r\n\r\nAll Xen systems running x86 HVM guests without stubdomains which have\r\nbeen configured with an emulated CD-ROM driver model are vulnerable.\r\n\r\nSystems using qemu-dm stubdomain device models (for example, by\r\nspecifying \"device_model_stubdomain_override=1\" in xl's domain\r\nconfiguration files) are NOT vulnerable.\r\n\r\nBoth the traditional (\"qemu-xen-traditional\") or upstream-based\r\n(\"qemu-xen\") qemu device models are potentially vulnerable.\r\n\r\nSystems running only PV guests are NOT vulnerable.\r\n\r\nARM systems are NOT vulnerable.\r\n\r\nReference:\r\nhttp://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q3/212"
