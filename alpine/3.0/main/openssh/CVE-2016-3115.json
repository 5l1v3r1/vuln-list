  "IssueID": 5288,
  "VulnerabilityID": "CVE-2016-3115",
  "Release": "3.0",
  "Package": "openssh",
  "Repository": "main",
  "FixedVersion": "6.6_p1-r8",
  "Subject": "[3.0] openssh: missing sanitisation of input for X11 forwarding (CVE-2016-3115)",
  "Description": "Missing sanitisation of untrusted input allows an authenticated user who is able to request X11 forwarding to inject commands to xauth(1).\r\n\r\nInjection of xauth commands grants the ability to read arbitrary files under the authenticated user's privilege. Other xauth commands allow\r\nlimited information leakage, file overwrite, port probing and generally expose xauth(1), which was not written with a hostile user in mind, as an attack surface.\r\n\r\nxauth(1) is run under the user's privilege, so this vulnerability offers no additional access to unrestricted accounts, but could circumvent key or account restrictions\r\nsuch as sshd_config ForceCommand, authorized_keys command=\"...\" or restricted shells.\r\n\r\nh3. Affected versions: \r\n\r\nAll versions of OpenSSH prior to 7.2p2 with X11Forwarding enabled.\r\n\r\nh3. Fixed In Version:\t\r\n\r\nopenssh 7.2p2\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.
