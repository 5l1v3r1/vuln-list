  "FixedVersion": "5.4.5.1-r0",
  "Subject": "[3.8] libreoffice: Remote arbitrary file disclosure vulnerability via WEBSERVICE formula (CVE-2018-6871)",
  "Description": "LibreOffice Calc supports a WEBSERVICE function to obtain data by URL. Vulnerable versions of LibreOffice allow \r\nWEBSERVICE to take a local file URL (e.g file://) which can be used to inject local files into the spreadsheet without \r\nwarning the user. Subsequent formulas can operate on that inserted data and construct a remote URL whose \r\npath leaks the local data to a remote attacker.\r\n\r\nIn later versions of LibreOffice without this flaw, WEBSERVICE has now been limited to accessing http and https URLs \r\nalong with bringing WEBSERVICE URLs under LibreOffice Calc's link management infrastructure.\r\n\r\nh3. Fixed in: \r\n\r\nLibreOffice 5.4.5/6.0.1\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.
