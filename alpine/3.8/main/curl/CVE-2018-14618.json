  "IssueID": 9394,
  "VulnerabilityID": "CVE-2018-14618",
  "Release": "3.8",
  "Package": "curl",
  "Repository": "main",
  "FixedVersion": "7.61.1-r0",
  "Subject": "[3.8] curl: NTLM password overflow via integer overflow (CVE-2018-14618)",
  "Description": "The internal function Curl_ntlm_core_mk_nt_hash multiplies the length of the password by two (SUM) \r\nto figure out how large temporary storage area to allocate from the heap. The length value is then subsequently \r\nused to iterate over the password and generate output into the allocated storage buffer. On systems with a 32 bit size_t, \r\nthe math to calculate SUM triggers an integer overflow when the password length exceeds 2GB (2^31 bytes). This integer \r\noverflow usually causes a very small buffer to actually get allocated instead of the intended very huge one, making the \r\nuse of that buffer end up in a heap buffer overflow.\r\n\r\nh3. Affected versions: \r\n\r\nlibcurl 7.15.4 to and including 7.61.0\r\n\r\nh3. Not affected versions: \r\n\r\nlibcurl \u003c 7.15.4 and \u003e= 7.61.1\r\n\r\nh3.
