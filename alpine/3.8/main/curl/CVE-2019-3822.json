  "Subject": "[3.8] curl: Multiple vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-16890, CVE-2019-3822, CVE-2019-3823)",
  "Description": "h2. CVE-2018-16890: NTLM type-2 out-of-bounds buffer read\r\n\r\nThe function handling incoming NTLM type-2 messages (lib/vauth/ntlm.c:ntlm_decode_type2_target) does not validate incoming data correctly and is subject to an integer overflow vulnerability.\r\nUsing that overflow, a malicious or broken NTLM server could trick libcurl to accept a bad length + offset combination that would lead to a buffer read out-of-bounds.\r\n\r\nh3. Affected versions: \r\n\r\nlibcurl 7.36.0 to and including 7.63.0\r\n\r\nh3. Not affected versions: \r\n\r\nlibcurl \u003c 7.36.0 and \u003e= 7.64.0\r\n\r\nh3. References:\r\n\r\nhttps://curl.haxx.se/docs/CVE-2018-16890.html\r\n\r\nh3. Patch:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/curl/curl/commit/b780b30d1377adb10bbe774835f49e9b237fb9bb\r\n\r\nh2. CVE-2019-3822: NTLMv2 type-3 header stack buffer overflow\r\n\r\nThe function creating an outgoing NTLM type-3 header (lib/vauth/ntlm.c:Curl_auth_create_ntlm_type3_message()), generates the request HTTP header contents based on previously received data. The check that exists to prevent the local buffer from getting overflowed is implemented wrongly (using unsigned math) and as such it does not prevent the overflow from happening.\r\nThis output data can grow larger than the local buffer if very large \"nt response\" data is extracted from a previous NTLMv2 header provided by the malicious or broken HTTP server. Such a \"large value\" needs to be around 1000 bytes or more. The actual payload data copied to the target buffer comes from the NTLMv2 type-2 response header.\r\n\r\nh3. Affected versions: \r\n\r\nlibcurl 7.36.0 to and including 7.63.0\r\n\r\nh3. Not affected versions: \r\n\r\nlibcurl \u003c 7.36.0 and \u003e= 7.64.0\r\n\r\nh3. References:\r\n\r\nhttps://curl.haxx.se/docs/CVE-2019-3822.html\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Patch:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/curl/curl/commit/86724581b6c\r\n\r\n\r\nh2. CVE-2019-3823: SMTP end-of-response out-of-bounds read\r\n\r\nIf the buffer passed to smtp_endofresp() isn't NUL terminated and contains no character ending the parsed number, and len is set to 5, \r\nthen the strtol() call reads beyond the allocated buffer. The read contents will not be returned to the caller.\r\n\r\nh3. Affected versions: \r\n\r\nlibcurl 7.34.0 to and including 7.63.0\r\n\r\nh3. Not affected versions: \r\n\r\nlibcurl \u003c 7.34.0\r\n\r\nh3. References:\r\n\r\nhttps://curl.haxx.se/docs/CVE-2019-3823.html\r\n\r\nh3.
