  "Subject": "[3.8] openssl: Cache timing vulnerability in RSA Key Generation (CVE-2018-0737)",
  "Description": "The OpenSSL RSA Key generation algorithm has been shown to be vulnerable to a\r\ncache timing side channel attack. An attacker with sufficient access to mount\r\ncache timing attacks during the RSA key generation process could recover the\r\nprivate key.\r\n\r\nDue to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing a new release of\r\nOpenSSL 1.1.0 or 1.0.2 at this time. The fix will be included in OpenSSL 1.1.0i\r\nand OpenSSL 1.0.2p when they become available. The fix is also available in\r\ncommit 6939eab03 (for 1.1.0) and commit 349a41da1 (for 1.0.2) in the OpenSSL git\r\nrepository.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.
