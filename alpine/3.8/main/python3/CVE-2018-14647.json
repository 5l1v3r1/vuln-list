  "Description": "h2. CVE-2018-14647: Missing salt initialization in _elementtree.c module\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in python's _elementtree.c module, a wrapper for libexpat XML parser. xml.etree C accelerator don't call XML_SetHashSalt(), failing to properly initiate \r\nthe random hash seed from a good CSPRNG source and making hash collision attacks with carefully crafted XML data easier.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Fixed In Version:\r\n\r\npython 3.7.1, python 3.6.7, python 2.7.16\r\n\r\nh3. References:\r\n\r\nhttps://bugs.python.org/issue34623\r\n\r\nh2. CVE-2018-20406: Integer overflow in Modules/_pickle.c allows for memory exhaustion if serializing gigabytes of data\r\n\r\nModules/_pickle.c in Python before 3.7.1 has an integer overflow via a large LONG_BINPUT value that is mishandled during a \"resize to twice the size\" attempt. \r\nThis issue might cause memory exhaustion, but is only relevant if the pickle format is used for serializing tens or hundreds of gigabytes of data.\r\n\r\nh3. References:\r\n\r\nhttps://bugs.python.org/issue34656\r\n\r\nh3. Patch:\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/python/cpython/commit/71a9c65e74a70b6ed39adc4ba81d311ac1aa2acc \r\n\r\n\r\nh2. CVE-2019-9636: Information Disclosure due to urlsplit improper NFKC normalization\r\n\r\nPython 2.7.x through 2.7.16 and 3.x through 3.7.2 is affected by: Improper Handling of Unicode Encoding (with an incorrect netloc) during NFKC normalization. \r\nThe impact is: Information disclosure (credentials, cookies, etc. that are cached against a given hostname). The components are: urllib.parse.urlsplit, urllib.parse.urlparse. \r\nThe attack vector is: A specially crafted URL could be incorrectly parsed to locate cookies or authentication data and send that information to a different host than when parsed correctly.\r\n\r\nh3.
