  "Release": "3.8",
  "Package": "bind",
  "Repository": "main",
  "FixedVersion": "9.12.4_p1-r0",
  "Subject": "[3.8] bind: Multiple vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-5743,  CVE-2019-6467)",
  "Description": "h2. CVE-2018-5743: Limiting simultaneous TCP clients is ineffective \r\n\r\nBy design, BIND is intended to limit the number of TCP clients that can be connected at any given time. The number of allowed connections is a tunable parameter which, if unset, defaults to a conservative value for \r\nmost servers. Unfortunately, the code which was intended to limit the number of simultaneous connections contains an error which can be exploited to grow the number of simultaneous connections beyond this limit.\r\n\r\nh3. Affected Versions:\r\n\r\nBIND 9.9.0 -\u003e 9.10.8-P1, 9.11.0 -\u003e 9.11.6, 9.12.0 -\u003e 9.12.4, 9.14.0. BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition versions 9.9.3-S1 -\u003e 9.11.5-S3, and 9.11.5-S5. \r\nVersions 9.13.0 -\u003e 9.13.7 of the 9.13 development branch are also affected.\r\n\r\nh3. Fixed In Version:\t\r\n\r\nbind 9.11.6-P1, bind 9.12.4-P1, bind 9.14.1\t\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.

CVE-2019-6467: flaw in nxredirect can cause assertion failure\r\n\r\nA programming error in the nxdomain-redirect feature can cause an assertion failure in query.c if the alternate namespace used by nxdomain-redirect is a descendant of a zone that is served locally.\r\nThe most likely scenario where this might occur is if the server, in addition to performing NXDOMAIN redirection for recursive clients, is also serving a local copy of the root zone or using mirroring \r\nto provide the root zone, although other configurations are also possible.\r\n\r\nh3. Affected Versions:\r\n\r\nBIND 9.12.0-\u003e 9.12.4, 9.14.0. Also affects all releases in the 9.13 development branch.\r\n\r\nh3. Fixed In Version:\r\n\r\nbind 9.12.4-P1, bind 9.14.1\t\r\n\r\nh3.
