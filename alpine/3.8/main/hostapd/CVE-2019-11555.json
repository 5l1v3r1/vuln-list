  "Description": "The EAP-pwd implementation in hostapd (EAP server) before 2.8 and wpa_supplicant (EAP peer) before 2.8 does not validate \r\nfragmentation reassembly state properly for a case where an unexpected fragment could be received. This could result in \r\nprocess termination due to a NULL pointer dereference (denial of service). This affects eap_server/eap_server_pwd.c and eap_peer/eap_pwd.c.\r\n\r\nh3.
