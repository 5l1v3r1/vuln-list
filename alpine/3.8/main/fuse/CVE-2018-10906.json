  "Package": "fuse",
  "Repository": "main",
  "FixedVersion": "2.9.8-r0",
  "Subject": "[3.8] fuse: bypass of the \"user_allow_other\" restriction when SELinux is active (CVE-2018-10906)",
  "Description": "In fuse before versions 2.9.8 and 3.x before 3.2.5, fusermount is\r\nvulnerable to a restriction bypass when SELinux is active. This allows\r\nnon-root users to mount a FUSE file system with the 'allow_other' mount\r\noption regardless of whether 'user_allow_other' is set in the fuse\r\nconfiguration. An attacker may use this flaw to mount a FUSE file system,\r\naccessible by other users, and trick them into accessing files on that file\r\nsystem, possibly causing Denial of Service or other unspecified effects.\r\n\r\nh3.
