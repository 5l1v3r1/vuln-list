  "Subject": "[3.8] libexif: Out-of-bounds heap read in exif_data_save_data_entry function (CVE-2017-7544)",
  "Description": "One heap-based out-of-bounds read vulnerabiltiy exists in libexif-0.6.21. When saving the data of an entry tagged with “EXIF_TAG_MAKER_NOTE” to \r\na buffer and copying the data of the exif entry, there is a mismatch between the computed read size of the entry data and the size of the allocated entry data. \r\nThe vulnerability can cause Denial-of-Service, even Information Disclosure (disclosing some critical heap chunk metadata, even other applications’ private data).\r\n\r\nh3.
