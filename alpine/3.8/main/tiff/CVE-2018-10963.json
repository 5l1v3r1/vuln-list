  "Package": "tiff",
  "Repository": "main",
  "FixedVersion": "4.0.9-r6",
  "Subject": "[3.8] tiff: Multiple vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-9935, CVE-2017-11613, CVE-2018-10963)",
  "Description": "*CVE-2017-9935*: In LibTIFF 4.0.8, there is a heap-based buffer overflow in the t2p_write_pdf function in tools/tiff2pdf.c. This heap overflow \r\ncould lead to different damages. For example, a crafted TIFF document can lead to an out-of-bounds read in TIFFCleanup, an invalid free in \r\nTIFFClose or t2p_free, memory corruption in t2p_readwrite_pdf_image, or a double free in t2p_free. \r\nGiven these possibilities, it probably could cause arbitrary code execution.\r\n\r\nh3. References:\r\n\r\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-9935\r\nhttp://bugzilla.maptools.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2704\r\n\r\n\r\n*CVE-2017-11613*: In LibTIFF 4.0.8, there is a denial of service vulnerability in the TIFFOpen function. A crafted input will lead to a denial of \r\nservice attack. During the TIFFOpen process, td_imagelength is not checked. The value of td_imagelength can be directly controlled by an input file. \r\nIn the ChopUpSingleUncompressedStrip function, the _TIFFCheckMalloc function is called based on td_imagelength. If we set the value of \r\ntd_imagelength close to the amount of system memory, it will hang the system or trigger the OOM killer.\r\n\r\nh3. References:\r\n\r\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-11613\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*CVE-2018-10963*: A flaw was found in LibTIFF through 4.0.9. TIFFWriteDirectorySec() function in tif_dirwrite.c allows remote attackers \r\nto cause a denial of service (assertion failure and application crash) via a crafted file.\r\n\r\nh3.
