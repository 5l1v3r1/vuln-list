  "Subject": "[3.4] heimdal: Orpheus' Lyre KDC-REP service name validation (CVE-2017-11103)",
  "Description": "Heimdal before 7.4 allows remote attackers to impersonate services with Orpheus' Lyre attacks because it obtains service-principal names \r\nin a way that violates the Kerberos 5 protocol specification. In _krb5_extract_ticket() the KDC-REP service name must be obtained from the \r\nencrypted version stored in 'enc_part' instead of the unencrypted version stored in 'ticket'. Use of the unencrypted version provides an \r\nopportunity for successful server impersonation and other attacks. NOTE: this CVE is only for Heimdal and other products that embed Heimdal\r\ncode; it does not apply to other instances in which this part of the Kerberos 5 protocol specification is violated.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.
