  "VulnerabilityID": "CVE-2016-6301",
  "Release": "3.4",
  "Package": "busybox",
  "Repository": "main",
  "FixedVersion": "1.24.2-r13",
  "Subject": "[3.4] busybox: NTP server denial of service flaw (CVE-2016-6301)",
  "Description": "The busybox NTP implementation doesn't check the NTP mode of packets received on the server port and responds to any packet with the right size. \r\nThis includes responses from another NTP server. An attacker can send a packet with a spoofed source address in order to create an infinite \r\nloop of responses between two busybox NTP servers. Adding more packets to the loop increases the traffic between the servers \r\nuntil one of them has a fully loaded CPU and/or network.\r\n\r\nh3. Fixed upstream in:\r\n\r\nbusybox 1.26.0\r\n\r\nh3. Reference:\r\n\r\nhttp://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q3/240\r\n\r\nh3. Patch:\r\n\r\nhttps://git.busybox.net/busybox/commit/?id=150dc7a2b483b8338a3e185c478b4b23ee884e71"
