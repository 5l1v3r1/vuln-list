  "IssueID": 7079,
  "VulnerabilityID": "CVE-2017-2629",
  "Release": "3.4",
  "Package": "curl",
  "Repository": "main",
  "FixedVersion": "7.52.1-r2",
  "Subject": "[3.4] curl: SSL_VERIFYSTATUS ignored (CVE-2017-2629 )",
  "Description": "A coding mistake was found in TLS Certificate Status Request extension feature that asks for a fresh proof of the server's certificate's \r\nvalidity in the code that checks for a test success or failure. It ends up always thinking there's valid proof, even when there is none or \r\nif the server doesn't support the TLS extension in question. Contrary to how it used to function and contrary to how this feature is documented to work.\r\n\r\nThis could lead to users not detecting when a server's certificate goes invalid or otherwise be mislead that the server is in a \r\nbetter shape than it is in reality. This flaw also exists in the command line tool (--cert-status).\r\n\r\nh3. Affected versions: \r\n\r\n7.52.0 to and including 7.52.1\r\n\r\nh3. Not affected versions: \r\n\r\n\u003c 7.52.0 and \u003e= 7.53.0\r\n\r\nh3. References:\r\n\r\nhttps://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20170222.html\r\n\r\nh3. Patch:\r\n\r\nhttps://curl.haxx.se/CVE-2017-2629.patch\r\n\r\n"
