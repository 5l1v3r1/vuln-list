  "Description": "A vulnerability exists in Mosquitto versions 0.15 to 1.4.11.\r\n\r\nPattern based ACLs can be bypassed by clients that set their username/client id to ‘#’ or ‘+’. This allows locally or remotely connected clients to access MQTT \r\ntopics that they do have the rights to. The same issue may be present in third party authentication/access control plugins for Mosquitto.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability only comes into effect where pattern based ACLs are in use, or potentially where third party plugins are in use.\r\n\r\nh3. Fixed In Version:\t\r\n\r\nmosquitto 1.4.12\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Reference:\r\n\r\nhttp://mosquitto.org/2017/05/security-advisory-cve-2017-7650/\r\n\r\nh3.
