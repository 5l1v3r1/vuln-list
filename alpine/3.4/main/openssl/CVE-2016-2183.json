  "VulnerabilityID": "CVE-2016-2183",
  "Release": "3.4",
  "Package": "openssl",
  "Repository": "main",
  "FixedVersion": "1.0.2i-r0",
  "Subject": "[3.4] openssl: Security issues (CVE-2016-2183, CVE-2016-6304, CVE-2016-6306)",
  "Description": "h2. CVE-2016-2183: SWEET32 Mitigation\r\n\r\nSWEET32 (https://sweet32.info) is an attack on older block cipher algorithms\r\nthat use a block size of 64 bits. In mitigation for the SWEET32 attack DES based\r\nciphersuites have been moved from the HIGH cipherstring group to MEDIUM in\r\nOpenSSL 1.0.1 and OpenSSL 1.0.2.  OpenSSL 1.1.0 since release has had these\r\nciphersuites disabled by default.\r\n\r\nOpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2i\r\nOpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1u\r\n\r\nh3. Reference:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160922.txt\r\n\r\n\r\nh2. CVE-2016-6304: OCSP Status Request extension unbounded memory growth\r\n\r\nA malicious client can send an excessively large OCSP Status Request extension.\r\nIf that client continually requests renegotiation, sending a large OCSP Status\r\nRequest extension each time, then there will be unbounded memory growth on the\r\nserver.\r\n\r\nOpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2i\r\nOpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1u\r\n\r\nh3. Reference:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160922.txt\r\n\r\n\r\nh2. CVE-2016-6306: Certificate message OOB reads\r\n\r\nIn OpenSSL 1.0.2 and earlier some missing message length checks can result in\r\nOOB reads of up to 2 bytes beyond an allocated buffer. There is a theoretical\r\nDoS risk but this has not been observed in practice on common platforms.\r\n\r\nOpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2i\r\nOpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1u\r\n\r\nh3. Reference:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160922.txt\r\n\r\n\r\n"
