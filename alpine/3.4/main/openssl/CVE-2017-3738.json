  "Subject": "[3.4] openssl: Multiple vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-3737, CVE-2017-3738)",
  "Description": "h2. CVE-2017-3737: Read/write after SSL object in error state\r\n\r\nOpenSSL 1.0.2 (starting from version 1.0.2b) introduced an \"error state\"\r\nmechanism. The intent was that if a fatal error occurred during a handshake then\r\nOpenSSL would move into the error state and would immediately fail if you\r\nattempted to continue the handshake. This works as designed for the explicit\r\nhandshake functions (SSL_do_handshake(), SSL_accept() and SSL_connect()),\r\nhowever due to a bug it does not work correctly if SSL_read() or SSL_write() is\r\ncalled directly. In that scenario, if the handshake fails then a fatal error\r\nwill be returned in the initial function call. If SSL_read()/SSL_write() is\r\nsubsequently called by the application for the same SSL object then it will\r\nsucceed and the data is passed without being decrypted/encrypted directly from\r\nthe SSL/TLS record layer.\r\n\r\nh3. Fixed In:\r\n\r\nopenssl 1.0.2n\r\n\r\nh3. References:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20171207.txt\r\n\r\n\r\nh2. CVE-2017-3738: rsaz_1024_mul_avx2 overflow bug on x86_64\r\n\r\nThere is an overflow bug in the AVX2 Montgomery multiplication procedure\r\nused in exponentiation with 1024-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are affected.\r\nAnalysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect\r\nwould be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks\r\nagainst DH1024 are considered just feasible, because most of the work\r\nnecessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline.\r\nThe amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant.\r\n\r\nh3. Fixed In:\r\n\r\nopenssl 1.0.2n\r\n\r\nh3. References:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20171207.txt"
