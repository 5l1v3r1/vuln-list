  "Subject": "[3.4] asterisk: Multiple vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-16671, CVE-2017-16672, CVE-2017-17090, CVE-2017-17664, CVE-2017-17850)",
  "Description": "h2. CVE-2017-16671: Buffer overflow in CDR's set user \r\n\r\nA Buffer Overflow issue was discovered in Asterisk Open Source 13 before 13.18.1, 14 before 14.7.1, and 15 before 15.1.1 \r\nand Certified Asterisk 13.13 before 13.13-cert7. No size checking is done when setting the user field for Party B on a CDR. Thus, it is \r\npossible for someone to use an arbitrarily large string and write past the end of the user field storage buffer. \r\n\r\nhttp://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2017-010.html\r\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-16671\r\n\r\nh2. CVE-2017-16672: Memory/File Descriptor/RTP leak in pjsip session resource \r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in Asterisk Open Source 13 before 13.18.1, 14 before 14.7.1, and 15 before 15.1.1 and Certified Asterisk 13.13 \r\nbefore 13.13-cert7. A memory leak occurs when an Asterisk pjsip session object is created and that call gets rejected before the session \r\nitself is fully established. When this happens the session object never gets destroyed. Eventually Asterisk can run out of memory and crash.\r\n\r\nh3.

CVE-2017-17090: DOS Vulnerability in Asterisk chan_skinny (3.7, 3.6-3.4)\r\n\r\nIf the chan_skinny (AKA SCCP protocol) channel driver is flooded with certain requests it can cause the asterisk process \r\nto use excessive amounts of virtual memory eventually causing asterisk to stop processing requests of any kind.\r\n\r\nh3. Fixed In Version:\r\n\r\nasterisk 13.18.3, asterisk 14.7.3, asterisk 15.1.3\r\n\r\nh3.

CVE-2017-17664: Remote Crash Vulnerability in RTCP Stack \r\n\r\nA Remote Crash issue was discovered in Asterisk Open Source 13.x before 13.18.4, 14.x before 14.7.4, and 15.x before 15.1.4 \r\nand Certified Asterisk before 13.13-cert9. Certain compound RTCP packets cause a crash in the RTCP Stack.\r\n\r\nh3. Fixed In Version:\r\n\r\nasterisk 13.18.4, asterisk 14.7.4, asterisk 15.1.4\r\n\r\nh3.

CVE-2017-17850: Crash in PJSIP resource when missing a contact header\r\n\r\nAn issue was discovered in Asterisk 13.18.4 and older, 14.7.4 and older, 15.1.4 and older, and 13.18-cert1 and older. A select set of SIP messages \r\ncreate a dialog in Asterisk. Those SIP messages must contain a contact header. For those messages, if the header was not \r\npresent and the PJSIP channel driver was used, Asterisk would crash. \r\n\r\nh3. Fixed In Version:\r\n\r\nasterisk 13.18.5, 14.7.5, 15.1.5\r\n\r\nh3.
