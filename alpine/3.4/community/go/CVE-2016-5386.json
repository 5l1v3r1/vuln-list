  "Release": "3.4",
  "Package": "go",
  "Repository": "community",
  "FixedVersion": "1.6.3-r0",
  "Subject": "[3.4] Go: sets environmental variable based on user supplied Proxy request header (CVE-2016-5386)",
  "Description": "\r\nMany software projects and vendors have implemented support for the “Proxy” request header in their respective CGI implementations and languages by creating the “HTTP_PROXY” \r\nenvironmental variable based on the header value. When this variable is used (in many cases automatically by various HTTP client libraries) any outgoing requests generated in turn \r\nfrom the attackers original request can be redirected to an attacker controlled proxy. This allows attackers to view potentially sensitive information, reply with malformed data, \r\nor to hold connections open causing a potential denial of service. \r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\nhttps://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2016-5386\r\nhttps://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-5386\r\n"
