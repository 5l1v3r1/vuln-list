  "Subject": "[3.2] libXfixes: Integer overflow on illegal server response (CVE-2016-7944)",
  "Description": "When receiving a response from the server protocol data is not validated sufficiently. \r\nThe 32 bit field \"rep.length\" is not checked for validity, which allows an integer overflow on 32 bit systems.\r\n\r\nA malicious server could send INT_MAX as length, which gets multiplied by the size of XRectangle. \r\nIn that case the client won't read the whole data from server, getting out of sync.\r\n\r\nh3. Affected versions : \r\n\r\nlibXfixes \u003c= 5.0.2\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Fixed In Version:\t\r\n\r\nlibXfixes 5.0.3\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.
