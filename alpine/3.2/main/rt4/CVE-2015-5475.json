  "Subject": "[v3.2] rt4: vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack via the user and group rights management pages and the cryptography interface (CVE-2015-5475)",
  "Description": "We have discovered security vulnerabilities which affect both RT 4.0.x and RT 4.2.x. We are releasing RT versions 4.0.24 and 4.2.12 to resolve these vulnerabilities, as well as patches which apply atop all released versions of 4.0 and 4.2.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerabilities addressed by 4.0.24, 4.2.12, and the below patches include the following:\r\n\r\nRT 4.0.0 and above are vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack via the user and group rights management pages. This vulnerability is assigned CVE-2015-5475. It was discovered and reported by Marcin KopeÄ‡ at Data Reliance Shared Service Center.\r\n\r\nRT 4.2.0 and above are vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack via the cryptography interface. This vulnerability could allow an attacker with a carefully-crafted key to inject JavaScript into RT's user interface. Installations which use neither GnuPG nor S/MIME are unaffected.\r\n\r\nPatches for all releases of 4.0.x and 4.2.x are available (signature). Versions of RT older than 4.0.0 are unsupported and do not receive security patches; please contact sales@bestpractical.com if you need assistance with an older RT version.\r\n\r\nReference:\r\n\u003e http://blog.bestpractical.com/2015/08/security-vulnerabilities-in-rt.html"
