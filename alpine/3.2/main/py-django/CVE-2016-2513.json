  "Subject": "[3.2] py-django: Multiple security issues  (CVE-2016-2512, CVE-2016-2513)",
  "Description": "h3. CVE-2016-2512: Malicious redirect and possible XSS attack via user-supplied redirect URLs containing basic auth\r\n\r\nDjango relies on user input in some cases (e.g. django.contrib.auth.views.login() and i18n) to redirect the user to an \"on success\" URL. \r\nThe security check for these redirects (namely django.utils.http.is_safe_url()) considered some URLs with basic authentication credentials \"safe\" when they shouldn't be.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. CVE-2016-2513: User enumeration through timing difference on password hasher work factor upgrade\r\n\r\nIn each major version of Django since 1.6, the default number of iterations for the PBKDF2PasswordHasher and its subclasses has increased.\r\nThis improves the security of the password as the speed of hardware increases, however, it also creates a timing difference between a login \r\nrequest for a user with a password encoded in an older number of iterations and login request for a nonexistent user (which runs the default hasher's default number of iterations since Django 1.6).\r\n\r\nh3. Fixed In Version:\r\n\t\r\npython-django *1.8.10*, python-django 1.9.3\r\n\r\nh3. References:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2016/mar/01/security-releases/\r\n\r\nh3. Patches: \r\n\r\nOn the 1.8 release branch: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/django/django/commit/382ab137312961ad62feb8109d70a5a581fe8350  (CVE-2016-2512)\r\nhttps://github.com/django/django/commit/f4e6e02f7713a6924d16540be279909ff4091eb6  (CVE-2016-2513)\r\n"
