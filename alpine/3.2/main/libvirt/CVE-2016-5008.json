  "Subject": "[3.2] libvirt: Setting empty VNC password allows access to unauthorized users (CVE-2016-5008)",
  "Description": "It was found that setting VNC password to empty string doesn't work in a way as it's documented. \r\nThe documented semantics of setting the password to an empty string are that it disables all access to the VNC server, \r\nhowever in fact it allows all users access with no authentication required instead.\r\n\r\nh3. References:\r\n\r\nhttp://security.libvirt.org/2016/0001.html\r\n\r\nh3. Patch:\r\n\r\nhttp://libvirt.org/git/?p=libvirt.git;a=commit;h=bb848feec0f3f10e92dd8e5231ae7aa89b5598f3\r\n\r\n"
