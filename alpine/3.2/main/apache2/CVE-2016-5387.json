  "Subject": "[3.2] apache2: sets environmental variable based on user supplied Proxy request header (CVE-2016-5387)",
  "Description": "The Apache HTTP Server through 2.4.23 follows RFC 3875 section 4.1.18 and therefore does not protect applications from \r\nthe presence of untrusted client data in the HTTP_PROXY environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to redirect\r\nan application's outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy server via a crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request, aka an \"httpoxy\" issue.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.
