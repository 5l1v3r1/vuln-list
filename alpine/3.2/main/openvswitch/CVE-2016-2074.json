  "Package": "openvswitch",
  "Repository": "main",
  "FixedVersion": "2.3.2-r1",
  "Subject": "[3.2] openvswitch: MPLS buffer overflow vulnerabilities (CVE-2016-2074)",
  "Description": "Multiple versions of Open vSwitch are vulnerable to remote buffer overflow attacks, in which crafted MPLS \r\npackets could overflow the buffer reserved for MPLS labels in an OVS internal data structure.\r\n\r\nOpen vSwitch 2.1.x and earlier are not vulnerable.\r\n\r\nIn Open vSwitch 2.2.x and *2.3.x*, the MPLS buffer overflow can be exploited for arbitrary remote code execution.\r\n\r\nIn Open vSwitch *2.4.x*, the MPLS buffer overflow does not obviously lead to a remote code execution exploit, \r\nbut testing shows that it can allow a remote denial of service.  \r\n\r\nOpen vSwitch 2.5.x is not vulnerable.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.
