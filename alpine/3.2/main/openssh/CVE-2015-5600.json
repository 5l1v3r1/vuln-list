  "FixedVersion": "6.8_p1-r3",
  "Subject": "[v3.2] OpenSSH: keyboard-interactive authentication brute force vulnerability (CVE-2015-5600)",
  "Description": "OpenSSH has a default value of six authentication tries before it will\r\nclose the connection (the ssh client allows only three password\r\nentries per default).\r\n\r\nWith this vulnerability an attacker is able to request as many\r\npassword prompts limited by the “login graced time” setting, that is\r\nset to two minutes by default.\r\n\r\nEspecially FreeBSD systems are affected by the vulnerability because\r\nthey have keyboard-interactive authentication enabled by default.\r\n\r\nA simple way to exploit the bug is to execute this command:\r\n\r\nssh -lusername -oKbdInteractiveDevices=`perl -e 'print \"pam,\" x\r\n10000'` targethost\r\n\r\nThis will effectively allow up to 10000 password entries limited by\r\nthe login grace time setting.\r\n\r\nThe crucial part is that if the attacker requests 10000\r\nkeyboard-interactive devices openssh will gracefully execute the\r\nrequest and will be inside a loop to accept passwords until the\r\nspecified devices are exceeded.\r\n\r\nReference:\r\nhttp://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2015/Jul/92\r\n"
