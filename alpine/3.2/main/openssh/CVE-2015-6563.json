  "Subject": "[v3.2] OpenSSH: multiple authentication issues (CVE-2015-6563, CVE-2015-6564, CVE-2015-6565)",
  "Description": "CVE-2015-6563\r\n\u003e The monitor component in sshd in OpenSSH before 7.0 on non-OpenBSD platforms accepts extraneous username data in MONITOR_REQ_PAM_INIT_CTX requests, which allows local users to conduct impersonation attacks by leveraging any SSH login access in conjunction with control of the sshd uid to send a crafted MONITOR_REQ_PWNAM request, related to monitor.c and monitor_wrap.c.\r\n\r\nCVE-2015-6564\r\n\u003e Use-after-free vulnerability in the mm_answer_pam_free_ctx function in monitor.c in sshd in OpenSSH before 7.0 on non-OpenBSD platforms might allow local users to gain privileges by leveraging control of the sshd uid to send an unexpectedly early MONITOR_REQ_PAM_FREE_CTX request.\r\n\r\nCVE-2015-6565\r\n\u003e sshd in OpenSSH 6.8 and 6.9 uses world-writable permissions for TTY devices, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (terminal disruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact by writing to a device, as demonstrated by writing an escape sequence.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\u003e http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q3/419\r\n\u003e https://cxsecurity.com/cveshow/CVE-2015-6563/\r\n\u003e https://cxsecurity.com/cveshow/CVE-2015-6564/\r\n\u003e https://cxsecurity.com/cveshow/CVE-2015-6565/"
