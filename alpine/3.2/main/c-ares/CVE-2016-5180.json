  "IssueID": 6259,
  "VulnerabilityID": "CVE-2016-5180",
  "Release": "3.2",
  "Package": "c-ares",
  "Repository": "main",
  "FixedVersion": "1.12.0-r0",
  "Subject": "[3.2] c-ares: Single byte out of buffer write (CVE-2016-5180)",
  "Description": "When a string is passed in to ares_create_query or ares_mkquery and uses an escaped trailing dot, like \"hello\\.\", c-ares calculates the string length wrong and \r\nsubsequently writes outside of the allocated buffer with one byte. The wrongly written byte is the least significant byte of the 'dnsclass' argument; most commonly 1.\r\nProof of concept code have showed how this can be exploited in a real-world system, but we are not aware of any exploits having actually happened in the wild.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Affected versions: \r\n\r\nc-ares 1.0.0 to and including 1.11.0\r\n\r\nh3. Fixed In Version:\t\r\n\r\nc-ares 1.12.0\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Reference:\r\n\r\nhttps://c-ares.haxx.se/adv_20160929.html\r\n\r\nh3. Patch:\r\n\r\nhttps://c-ares.haxx.se/CVE-2016-5180.patch\r\n\r\n"
