  "Subject": "[3.5] libxcursor: heap overflows when parsing malicious files (CVE-2017-16612)",
  "Description": "It is possible to trigger heap overflows due to an integer overflow while parsing images and a signedness issue while parsing comments.\r\nThe integer overflow occurs because the chosen limit 0x10000 for dimensions is too large for 32 bit systems, because each pixel takes\r\n4 bytes. Properly chosen values allow an overflow which in turn will lead to less allocated memory than needed for subsequent reads.\r\n\r\nh3. Fixed In Version:\r\n\r\nlibXcursor 1.1.15\r\n\r\nh3. References:\r\n\r\nhttp://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/11/28/6\r\n\r\nh3.
