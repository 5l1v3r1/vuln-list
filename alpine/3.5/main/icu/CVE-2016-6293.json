  "FixedVersion": "57.1-r1",
  "Subject": "[3.5] icu: Out-of-bounds access in uloc_acceptLanguageFromHTTP (CVE-2016-6293) ",
  "Description": "The uloc_acceptLanguageFromHTTP function in common/uloc.cpp in International Components for Unicode (ICU) through 57.1 for C/C++ does not \r\nensure that there is a '\\0' character at the end of a certain temporary array, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read)\r\nor possibly have unspecified other impact via a call with a long httpAcceptLanguage argument.\r\n\r\nh3. Reference:\r\n\r\nhttps://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-6293\r\n\r\nh3. Patch:\r\n\r\nhttp://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/changeset/39109\r\n\r\nAnd possibly needs some more follow-up fixes, cf. with upstream changes\r\naround/later than changeset 39109.\r\n"
