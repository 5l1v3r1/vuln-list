  "Description": "h2. CVE-2018-0737: Cache timing vulnerability in RSA Key Generation \r\n\r\nThe OpenSSL RSA Key generation algorithm has been shown to be vulnerable to a\r\ncache timing side channel attack. An attacker with sufficient access to mount\r\ncache timing attacks during the RSA key generation process could recover the\r\nprivate key.\r\n\r\nDue to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing a new release of\r\nOpenSSL 1.1.0 or 1.0.2 at this time. The fix will be included in OpenSSL 1.1.0i\r\nand OpenSSL 1.0.2p when they become available. The fix is also available in\r\ncommit 6939eab03 (for 1.1.0) and commit 349a41da1 (for 1.0.2) in the OpenSSL git\r\nrepository.\r\n\r\nh3.

CVE-2018-0739: Constructed ASN.1 types with a recursive definition could exceed the stack \r\n\r\n\r\nConstructed ASN.1 types with a recursive definition (such as can be found in\r\nPKCS7) could eventually exceed the stack given malicious input with\r\nexcessive recursion. This could result in a Denial Of Service attack. There are\r\nno such structures used within SSL/TLS that come from untrusted sources so this\r\nis considered safe.\r\n\r\nOpenSSL 1.1.0 users should upgrade to 1.1.0h\r\nOpenSSL 1.0.2 users should upgrade to 1.0.2o\r\n\r\nh3.
