  "Package": "openssl",
  "Repository": "main",
  "FixedVersion": "1.0.2h-r4",
  "Subject": "[3.5] openssl: Multiple issues (CVE-2016-2179, CVE-2016-2181, CVE-2016-2182, CVE-2016-6302, CVE-2016-6303)",
  "Description": "h3. CVE-2016-2179: \r\n\r\nThe DTLS implementation in OpenSSL before 1.1.0 does not properly restrict the lifetime of queue entries associated with\r\nunused out-of-order messages, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by maintaining\r\nmany crafted DTLS sessions simultaneously, related to d1_lib.c, statem_dtls.c, statem_lib.c, and statem_srvr.c.\r\n\r\nh3. Reference:\r\n\r\nhttps://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-2179\r\n\r\nh3. CVE-2016-2181: \r\n\r\nThe Anti-Replay feature in the DTLS implementation in OpenSSL before 1.1.0 mishandles early use of a new epoch number in \r\nconjunction with a large sequence number, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (false-positive packet drops)\r\nvia spoofed DTLS records, related to rec_layer_d1.c and ssl3_record.c.\r\n\r\nh3. Reference:\r\n\r\nhttps://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-2181\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. CVE-2016-2182:\r\n\r\nThe BN_bn2dec function in crypto/bn/bn_print.c in OpenSSL before 1.1.0 does not properly validate division results, \r\nwhich allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors.\r\n\r\nh3. Reference:\r\n\r\nhttps://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-2182\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. CVE-2016-6302: \r\n\r\nThe tls_decrypt_ticket function in ssl/t1_lib.c in OpenSSL before 1.1.0 does not consider the HMAC size during validation of \r\nthe ticket length, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a ticket that is too short.\r\n\r\nh3. Reference:\r\n\r\nhttps://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-6302\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. CVE-2016-6303:\r\n\r\nThe tls_decrypt_ticket function in ssl/t1_lib.c in OpenSSL before 1.1.0 does not consider the HMAC size during validation \r\nof the ticket length, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a ticket that is too short.\r\n\r\nh3.
