  "Subject": "[3.5] mercurial: HTTP server permissions bypass (CVE-2018-1000132)",
  "Description": "All versions of Mercurial prior to 4.5.2 have vulnerabilities in the HTTP server that allow permissions bypass to:\r\n\r\nPerform writes on repositories that should be read-only.\r\nPerform reads on repositories that shouldn't allow read access.\r\n\r\nWire protocol commands that didn't explicitly declare their permissions had no permissions checking done. \r\nThe web.{allow-pull, allow-push, deny_read, etc} config options governing access control were never consulted \r\nwhen running these commands. This allowed permissions bypass for impacted commands. \r\nThe batch wire protocol command did not list its permission requirements nor did it enforce permissions on individual sub-commands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.
