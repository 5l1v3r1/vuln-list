  "Description": "h2. CVE-2018-16839: SASL password overflow via integer overflow\r\n\r\nThe internal function Curl_auth_create_plain_message fails to correctly verify that the passed in lengths \r\nfor name and password aren't too long, then calculates a buffer size to allocate.\r\n\r\nOn systems with a 32 bit size_t, the math to calculate the buffer size triggers an integer overflow when the user name length exceeds 2GB (2^31 bytes). \r\nThis integer overflow usually causes a very small buffer to actually get allocated instead of the intended very huge one, making the use of that buffer end up in a heap buffer overflow.\r\n\r\nh3. Affected versions: \r\n\r\nlibcurl 7.33.0 to and including 7.61.1\r\n\r\nh3. Not affected versions: \r\n\r\nlibcurl \u003c 7.33.0 and \u003e= 7.62.0\r\n\r\nh3. Reference:\r\n\r\nhttps://curl.haxx.se/docs/CVE-2018-16839.html\r\n\r\nh3. Patch:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/curl/curl/commit/f3a24d7916b9173c69a3e0ee790102993833d6c5\r\n\r\nh2. CVE-2018-16840: use-after-free in handle close\r\n\r\nWhen closing and cleaning up an \"easy\" handle in the Curl_close() function, the library code first frees a struct (without nulling the pointer) and might \r\nthen subsequently erroneously write to a struct field within that already freed struct.\r\n\r\nh3. Affected versions:\r\n\r\nlibcurl 7.59.0 to and including 7.61.1\r\n\r\nh3. Not affected versions: \r\n\r\nlibcurl \u003c 7.59.0 and \u003e= 7.62.0\r\n\r\nh3. Reference:\r\n\r\nhttps://curl.haxx.se/docs/CVE-2018-16840.html\r\n\r\nh3. Patch:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/curl/curl/commit/81d135d67155c5295b1033679c606165d4e28f3f\r\n\r\nh2. CVE-2018-16842: warning message out-of-buffer read\r\n\r\nThe command line tool has a generic function for displaying warning and informational messages to stderr for various \r\nsituations. For example if an unknown command line argument is used, or passed to it in a \"config\" file.\r\n\r\nThis display function formats the output to wrap at 80 columns. The wrap logic is however flawed, so if a single word in the message is itself longer than 80 bytes \r\nthe buffer arithmetic calculates the remainder wrong and will end up reading behind the end of the buffer. This could lead to information disclosure or crash.\r\n\r\nh3. Reference:\r\n\r\nhttps://curl.haxx.se/docs/CVE-2018-16842.html\r\n\r\nh3.
