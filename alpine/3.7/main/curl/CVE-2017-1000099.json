  "Description": "h2. CVE-2017-1000099: FILE buffer read out of bounds\r\n\r\nWhen asking to get a file from a file:// URL, libcurl provides a feature that\r\noutputs meta-data about the file using HTTP-like headers.\r\n\r\nThe code doing this would send the wrong buffer to the user (stdout or the\r\napplication's provide callback), which could lead to other private data from\r\nthe heap to get inadvertently displayed.\r\n\r\n*Affected versions*: libcurl 7.54.1\r\n\r\n*Not affected versions*: libcurl \u003c 7.54.1 and \u003e= 7.55.0\r\n\r\nh3. References:\r\n\r\nhttps://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20170809C.html\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Patch:\r\n\r\nhttps://curl.haxx.se/CVE-2017-1000099.patch\r\n\r\nh2. CVE-2017-1000100: TFTP sends more than buffer size\r\n\r\nWhen doing an TFTP upload and curl/libcurl is given a URL that contains a very\r\nlong file name (longer than about 515 bytes), the file name is truncated to\r\nfit within the buffer boundaries, but the buffer size is still wrongly updated\r\nto use the untruncated length. This too large value is then used in the\r\n`send()` call, making curl attempt to send more data than what is actually put\r\ninto the buffer. The `send()` function will then read beyond the end of the\r\nheap based buffer.\r\n\r\n*Affected versions*: libcurl 7.15.0 to and including 7.54.1\r\n\r\n*Not affected versions*: libcurl \u003c 7.15.0 and \u003e= 7.55.0\r\n\r\nh3. References:\r\n\r\nhttps://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20170809B.html\r\n\r\nh3. Patch:\r\n\r\nhttps://curl.haxx.se/CVE-2017-1000100.patch\r\n\r\nh2. CVE-2017-1000101: URL globbing out of bounds read\r\n\r\nIn the globbing function that parses the numerical range, there was an\r\nomission that made curl read a byte beyond the end of the URL if given a\r\ncarefully crafted, or just wrongly written, URL. The URL is stored in a heap\r\nbased buffer, so it could then be made to wrongly read something else instead\r\nof crashing.\r\n\r\n*Affected versions*: curl 7.34.0 to and including 7.54.1\r\n\r\n*Not affected versions:* curl \u003c 7.34.0 and \u003e= 7.55.0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. References:\r\n\r\nhttps://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20170809A.html\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Patch:\r\n\r\nhttps://curl.haxx.se/CVE-2017-1000101.patch\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
