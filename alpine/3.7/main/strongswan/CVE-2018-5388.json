  "Subject": "[3.7] strongswan: integer underflow leads to buffer overflow and denial of service in stroke_socket.c (CVE-2018-5388)",
  "Description": "A flaw was found in strongSwan VPN's charon server prior to version 5.6.3. In stroke_socket.c, a missing packet length check could allow \r\na integer underflow, which may lead to resource exhaustion and denial of service while reading from the socket. A remote attacker with \r\nlocal user credentials (possibly a normal user in the vpn group, or root) may be able to overflow the buffer and cause a denial of service.\r\n\r\nh3. Fixed In Version:\t\r\n\r\nstrongswan 5.6.3\t\r\n\r\nh3.
