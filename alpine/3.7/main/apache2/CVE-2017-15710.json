  "Description": "h2. CVE-2017-15710: Out of bound write in mod_authnz_ldap when using too small Accept-Language values\r\n\r\nh3. Affected Versions:\r\n\r\nhttpd 2.4.1 to 2.4.29\r\n\r\nh3. Fixed in: \r\n\r\nApache httpd 2.4.30\r\n\r\nh3. References:\r\n\r\nhttps://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html\r\n\r\nh2. CVE-2017-15715: \u003cFilesMatch\u003e bypass with a trailing newline in the file name\r\n\r\nThe expression specified in \u003cFilesMatch\u003e could match '$' to a newline character in a malicious filename, rather than matching only the end of the filename.\r\nThis could be exploited in environments where uploads of some files are are externally blocked, but only by matching the trailing portion of the filename.\r\n\r\nh3. Affected Versions:\r\n\r\nhttpd 2.4.1 to 2.4.29\r\n\r\nh3. References:\r\n\r\nhttps://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html\r\nhttp://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2018/03/24/6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh2. CVE-2018-1301: Possible out of bound access after failure in reading the HTTP request\r\n\r\nA specially crafted request could have crashed the Apache HTTP Server prior to\r\nversion 2.4.30, due to an out of bound access after a size limit is reached by\r\nreading the HTTP header. \r\n\r\nAffected Versions:\r\n\r\nhttpd 2.4.1 to 2.4.29\r\n\r\nh3. Fixed in:\r\n\r\nApache httpd 2.4.30\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. References:\r\n\r\nhttps://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html\r\nhttp://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2018/03/24/2\r\n\r\n\r\nh2. CVE-2018-1302: Possible write of after free on HTTP/2 stream shutdown\r\n\r\nWhen an HTTP/2 stream was destroyed after being handled, the Apache HTTP Server prior to version 2.4.30 \r\ncould have written a NULL pointer potentially to an already freed memory.\r\n\r\nh3. Affected Versions:\r\n\r\nhttpd 2.4.17 to 2.4.29\r\n\r\nh3. Fixed in: \r\n\r\nApache httpd 2.4.30\r\n\r\nh3. References:\r\n\r\nhttps://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html\r\nhttp://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2018/03/24/5\r\n\r\nh2. CVE-2018-1303: Possible out of bound read in mod_cache_socache\r\n\r\nA specially crafted HTTP request header could have crashed the Apache HTTP Server prior to version 2.4.30 due to an out of bound read \r\nwhile preparing data to be cached in shared memory. It could be used as a Denial of Service attack against users of mod_cache_socache.\r\n\r\nh3. Affected Versions:\r\n\r\nhttpd 2.4.6 to 2.4.29\r\n\r\nh3. Fixed in: \r\n\r\nApache httpd 2.4.30\r\n\r\nh3. References:\r\n\r\nhttps://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html\r\nhttp://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2018/03/24/3\r\n\r\nh2. CVE-2018-1283: Tampering of mod_session data for CGI applications\r\n\r\nWhen mod_session is configured to forward its session data to CGI applications (SessionEnv on, not the default), a remote user may influence their content by \r\nusing a \"Session\" header. This comes from the \"HTTP_SESSION\" variable name used by mod_session to forward its data to CGIs, since the prefix \"HTTP_\" is \r\nalso used by the Apache HTTP Server to pass HTTP header fields, per CGI specifications.\r\n\r\nh3. Affected Versions:\r\n\r\nhttpd 2.4.1 to 2.4.29\r\n\r\nh3. Fixed in: \r\n\r\nApache httpd 2.4.30\r\n\r\nh3.

CVE-2018-1312: Weak Digest auth nonce generation in mod_auth_digest\r\n\r\nWhen generating an HTTP Digest authentication challenge, the nonce sent to prevent reply attacks was not correctly generated using a pseudo-random seed.\r\nIn a cluster of servers using a common Digest authentication configuration, HTTP requests could be replayed across servers by an attacker without detection.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Affected Versions:\r\n\r\nhttpd 2.4.1 to 2.4.29\r\n\r\nh3. Fixed in: \r\n\r\nApache httpd 2.4.30\r\n\r\nh3. References:\r\n\r\nhttps://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html"
