CVE-2019-0220: URL normalization inconsistincies\r\n\r\nWhen the path component of a request URL contains multiple consecutive slashes\r\n('/'), directives such as LocationMatch and RewriteRule must account for\r\nduplicates in regular expressions while other aspects of the servers processing\r\nwill implicitly collapse them.\r\n\r\nh3. Versions Affected:\r\n\r\nhttpd 2.4.0 to 2.4.38\r\n\r\nh3. Fixed In Version:\r\n\r\nApache httpd 2.4.39\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\nhttps://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html\r\n\r\n"
