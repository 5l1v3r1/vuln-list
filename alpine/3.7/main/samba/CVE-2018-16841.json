  "Subject": "[3.7] samba: Multiple vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-14629, CVE-2018-16841, CVE-2018-16851)",
  "Description": "h2. CVE-2018-14629:  Unprivileged adding of CNAME record causing loop in AD Internal DNS server\r\n\r\nAll versions of Samba from 4.0.0 onwards are vulnerable to infinite\r\nquery recursion caused by CNAME loops. Any dns record can be added via\r\nldap by an unprivileged user using the ldbadd tool, so this is a\r\nsecurity issue.\r\n\r\nh3. Fixed In Version:\r\n\r\nSamba 4.7.12, 4.8.7, and 4.9.3\r\n\r\nh3. References:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2018-14629.html\r\nhttps://www.samba.org/samba/history/security.html\r\n\r\n\r\nh2. CVE-2018-16841 : Double-free in Samba AD DC KDC with PKINIT\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in Samba from 4.3.0 versions. When configured to accept smart-card authentication, Samba's KDC \r\nwill call talloc_free() twice on the same memory if the principal in a validly signed certificate does not match the principal in the AS-REQ. \r\nThis is only possible after authentication with a trusted certificate. This could result in a Denial of Service attack.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Fixed In Version:\r\n\r\nSamba 4.7.12, 4.8.7 and 4.9.3\r\n\r\nh3. References:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2018-16841.html\r\nhttps://www.samba.org/samba/history/security.html\r\n\r\nh2. CVE-2018-16851: NULL pointer de-reference in Samba AD DC LDAP server\r\n\r\nA flaw was found in Samba versions from 4.0.0. During the processing of an LDAP search before Samba's AD DC returns the LDAP \r\nentries to the client, the entries are cached in a single memory object with a maximum size of 256MB.  When this size is reached, the \r\nSamba process providing the LDAP service will follow the NULL pointer, terminating the process. This can lead to a denial of service attack.\r\n\r\nh3. Fixed In Version:\r\n\r\nSamba 4.7.12, 4.8.7 and 4.9.3\r\n\r\nh3. References:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2018-16851.html\r\nhttps://www.samba.org/samba/history/security.html\r\n"
