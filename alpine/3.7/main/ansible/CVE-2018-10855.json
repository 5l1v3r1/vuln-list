  "Subject": "[3.7] ansible: Failed tasks do not honour no_log option allowing for secrets to be disclosed in logs (CVE-2018-10855)",
  "Description": "Ansible 2.5 prior to 2.5.5, and 2.4 prior to 2.4.5, do not honor the no_log task flag for failed tasks. When the no_log flag has been \r\nused to protect sensitive data passed to a task from being logged, and that task does not run successfully, Ansible will expose \r\nsensitive data in log files and on the terminal of the user running Ansible.\r\n\r\nUnsure if it affects alpine 3.6 and 3.5.\r\n\r\nh3.
