  "Package": "subversion",
  "Repository": "main",
  "FixedVersion": "1.9.7-r0",
  "Subject": "[3.7] subversion: Arbitrary code execution on clients through malicious svn+ssh URLs (CVE-2017-9800)",
  "Description": "A Subversion client sometimes connects to URLs provided by the repository.\r\nThis happens in two primary cases: during 'checkout', 'export', 'update', and\r\n'switch', when the tree being downloaded contains svn:externals properties;\r\nand when using 'svnsync sync' with one URL argument.\r\n\r\nA maliciously constructed svn+ssh:// URL would cause Subversion clients to\r\nrun an arbitrary shell command.  Such a URL could be generated by a malicious\r\nserver, by a malicious user committing to a honest server (to attack another\r\nuser of that server's repositories), or by a proxy server.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability affects all clients, including those that use file://,\r\nhttp://, and plain (untunneled) svn://.\r\n\r\nh3. Fixed In Version:\t\r\n\r\nsubversion 1.8.18, *subversion 1.9.7*\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. References:\r\n\r\nhttps://subversion.apache.org/security/CVE-2017-9800-advisory.txt\r\n\r\n"
