  "FixedVersion": "7.4.0-r2",
  "Subject": "[3.7] heimdal: NULL pointer dereference via crafted UDP packets (CVE-2017-17439)",
  "Description": "In Heimdal through 7.4, remote unauthenticated attackers are able to crash the KDC by sending a crafted UDP packet \r\ncontaining empty data fields for client name or realm. The parser would unconditionally dereference NULL pointers in \r\nthat case, leading to a segmentation fault. This is related to the _kdc_as_rep function in kdc/kerberos5.c and \r\nthe der_length_visible_string function in lib/asn1/der_length.c.\r\n\r\nh3.
