  "VulnerabilityID": "CVE-2016-3958",
  "Release": "3.3",
  "Package": "go",
  "Repository": "community",
  "FixedVersion": "1.5.4-r0",
  "Subject": "[3.3] go: security issues (CVE-2016-3958, CVE-2016-3959)",
  "Description": "On Windows, Go loads system DLLs by name with LoadLibrary, making it vulnerable to DLL preloading attacks. For instance, \r\nif a user runs a Go executable from a Downloads folder, malicious DLL files also downloaded to that folder could be loaded into that executable.\r\nThis is *CVE-2016-3958* and was addressed by this change: https://golang.org/cl/21428\r\n\r\nGo's crypto libraries passed certain parameters unchecked to the underlying big integer library, possibly leading to extremely long-running computations, \r\nwhich in turn makes Go programs vulnerable to remote denial of service attacks.Â  Programs using HTTPS client certificates or the Go SSH server libraries are both exposed to this vulnerability.\r\nThis is *CVE-2016-3959* and was addressed by this change: https://golang.org/cl/21533\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.
