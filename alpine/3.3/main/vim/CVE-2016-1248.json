  "Description": "A vulnerability was found in Vim which would allow arbitrary shell commands to be run if a user opened a file with a malicious modeline.  \r\nThis is due to lack of validation of values for a few options.  Those options' values are then used in Vim's scripts to build\r\na command string that's evaluated by :execute, which is what allows the shell commands to be run.\r\n\r\nh3. Fixed In Version: \t\r\n\r\nvim 8.0.0056\r\n\r\nh3. Reference:\r\n\r\nhttp://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q4/506\r\n\r\nh3.
