  "IssueID": 8117,
  "VulnerabilityID": "CVE-2017-3736",
  "Release": "3.3",
  "Package": "openssl",
  "Repository": "main",
  "FixedVersion": "1.0.2m-r0",
  "Subject": "[3.3] openssl: Multiple vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-3735, CVE-2017-3736)",
  "Description": "h2. CVE-2017-3735: Malformed X.509 IPAdressFamily could cause OOB read\r\n\r\nIf an X.509 certificate has a malformed IPAddressFamily extension,\r\nOpenSSL could do a one-byte buffer overread. The most likely result\r\nwould be an erroneous display of the certificate in text format.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Fixed In Version:\t\r\n\r\nopenssl 1.0.2m, openssl 1.1.0g\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. References:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20170828.txt\r\n\r\nh2. CVE-2017-3736: bn_sqrx8x_internal carry bug on x86_64 \r\n\r\nThere is a carry propagating bug in the x86_64 Montgomery squaring procedure. No\r\nEC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA\r\nas a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not\r\nbelieved likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very\r\ndifficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information\r\nabout a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources\r\nrequired for such an attack would be very significant and likely only\r\naccessible to a limited number of attackers. An attacker would\r\nadditionally need online access to an unpatched system using the target\r\nprivate key in a scenario with persistent DH parameters and a private\r\nkey that is shared between multiple clients.\r\n\r\nThis only affects processors that support the BMI1, BMI2 and ADX extensions like\r\nIntel Broadwell (5th generation) and later or AMD Ryzen.\r\n\r\nh3. Fixed In Version:\t\r\n\r\nopenssl 1.0.2m, openssl 1.1.0g\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. References:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20171102.txt\r\n\r\n\r\n"
