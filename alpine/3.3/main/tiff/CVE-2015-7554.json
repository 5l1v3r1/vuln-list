  "Description": "h2. CVE-2015-7554: invalid write\r\n\r\nThe _TIFFVGetField function in tif_dir.c in libtiff 4.0.6 allows attackers to cause a denial of service \r\n(invalid memory write and crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted field data in an extension tag in a TIFF image.\r\n\r\nh3. References:\r\n\r\nhttp://seclists.org/bugtraq/2015/Dec/137\r\nhttp://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/12/26/7\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh2. CVE-2015-8668: OOB read in bmp2tiff\r\n\r\nHeap-based buffer overflow in the PackBitsPreEncode function in tif_packbits.c in bmp2tiff in libtiff 4.0.6 and earlier\r\nallows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service via a large width field in a BMP image.\r\n\r\nh3. Reference:\r\n\r\nhttp://seclists.org/bugtraq/2015/Dec/138\r\n\r\n                 \r\n\r\nh2. CVE-2016-3945: out-of-bounds write in the tiff2rgba tool\r\n\r\nWhen libtiff 4.0.6 tiff2rgba handle malicious tif file(width= 8388640, height=31) and set param -b will cause illegal \r\nwrite. The vulnerability exist in function cvt_by_strip (also exist in cvt_by_tile ) without checking the buffer \r\nallocate result. An attacker may control the write address and/or value to result in denial-of-service or command \r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nh3. Reference:\r\n\r\nhttp://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q2/30\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh2. CVE-2016-3632: out-of-bounds write in _TIFFVGetField function\r\n\r\nOut-of-bounds write vulnerability was found in _TIFFVGetField function in tif_dirinfo.c, allowing attacker to cause\r\na denial of service or command execution via a crafted TIFF image.\r\n\r\nh3. Reference:\r\n\r\nhttp://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q2/33\r\n\r\n\r\nh2. CVE-2016-3990: out-of-bounds write in horizontalDifference8()\r\n\r\nAn out-of-bounds write flaw was found in libtiff v4.0.6 when using tiffcp command to handle malicious tiff file. \r\nThe vulnerability exists in function horizontalDifference8()\r\nAn attacker could control the head data of next heap which contains pre_size field and size filed to result in DoS or potential code execution.\r\n\r\nh3. Reference:\r\n\r\nhttp://seclists.org/oss-sec/2016/q2/57\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh2.
