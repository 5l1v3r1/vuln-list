  "IssueID": 7176,
  "VulnerabilityID": "CVE-2017-7468",
  "Release": "3.3",
  "Package": "curl",
  "Repository": "main",
  "FixedVersion": "7.52.1-r1",
  "Subject": "[3.3] curl: TLS session resumption client cert bypass (CVE-2017-7468)",
  "Description": "libcurl would attempt to resume a TLS session even if the client certificate had changed. That is unacceptable since a \r\nserver by specification is allowed to skip the client certificate check on resume, and may instead use the old identity which\r\nwas established by the previous certificate (or no certificate).\r\n\r\nlibcurl supports by default the use of TLS session id/ticket to resume previous TLS sessions to speed up subsequent TLS handshakes.\r\nThey are used when for any reason an existing TLS connection couldn't be kept alive to make the next handshake faster.\r\n\r\nThis flaw is a regression and identical to CVE-2016-5419\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Affected versions:\r\n\r\ncurl 7.52.0 to and including 7.53.1\r\n\r\nh3. Not affected versions:\r\n\r\ncurl \u003c 7.52.0 and \u003e= 7.54.0\r\n\r\nh3.
