  "Description": "The try_read_command function in memcached.c in memcached before 1.4.39 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) \r\nvia a request to add/set a key, which makes a comparison between signed and unsigned int and triggers a heap-based buffer over-read. \r\nNOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-8705.\r\n\r\nh3.
