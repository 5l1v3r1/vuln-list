  "Subject": "[3.9] keepalived: Multiple vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-19044, CVE-2018-19045, CVE-2018-19046)",
  "Description": "*CVE-2018-19044*: kkeepalived before version 2.0.9 didn't check for pathnames with symlinks when writing data to a temporary file upon a call to PrintData or PrintStats. This allowed local users to overwrite arbitrary files if fs.protected_symlinks is set to 0, as demonstrated by a symlink from /tmp/keepalived.data or /tmp/keepalived.stats to /etc/passwd.\r\n\r\nh3. Fixed In Version:\r\n\r\nkeepalived 2.0.9\r\n\r\nh3. References:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/acassen/keepalived/issues/1048\r\nhttp://www.keepalived.org/changelog.html\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.

Fixed In Version:\r\n\r\nkeepalived 2.0.9\r\n\r\nh3. References:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/acassen/keepalived/issues/1048\r\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-19045\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.

If a local attacker had previously created a file with the expected name (e.g., /tmp/keepalived.data or /tmp/keepalived.stats), with read access for the attacker and write access for the keepalived process, then this potentially leaked sensitive information.\r\n\r\nh3. Fixed In Version:\r\n\r\nkeepalived 2.0.10\r\n\r\nh3. References:\r\n\r\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-19046\r\nhttps://github.com/acassen/keepalived/issues/1048\r\n\r\nh3.
