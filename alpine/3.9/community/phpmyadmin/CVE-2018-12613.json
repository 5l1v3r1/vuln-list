  "Description": "h2. CVE-2018-12581: XSS in Designer feature\r\n\r\nA Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability was found in the Designer feature, where an attacker can \r\ndeliver a payload to a user through a specially-crafted database name.\r\n\r\nh3. Affected Versions:\r\n\r\nphpMyAdmin versions prior to 4.8.2.\r\n\r\nh3. Reference:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.phpmyadmin.net/security/PMASA-2018-3/\r\n\r\nh3. Patch:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/commit/6943fff87324bd54c3a37a5160a5fb77498c355e\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh2. CVE-2018-12613: File inclusion and remote code execution attack\r\n\r\nA flaw has been discovered where an attacker can include (view and potentially execute) files on the server.\r\nThe vulnerability comes from a portion of code where pages are redirected and loaded within phpMyAdmin, and an improper test for whitelisted pages.\r\nAn attacker must be authenticated, except in these situations:\r\n* $cfg['AllowArbitraryServer'] = true: attacker can specify any host he/she is already in control of, and execute arbitrary code on phpMyAdmin\r\n* $cfg['ServerDefault'] = 0: this bypasses the login and runs the vulnerable code without any authentication\r\n\r\nh3. Affected Versions:\r\n\r\nphpMyAdmin 4.8.0 and 4.8.1 are affected.\r\n\r\nh3. Reference:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.phpmyadmin.net/security/PMASA-2018-4/\r\n\r\nh3. Patch:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/commit/7662d02939fb3cf6f0d9ec32ac664401dcfe7490\r\n\r\n"
