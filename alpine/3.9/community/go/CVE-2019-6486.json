  "Subject": "[3.9] go: crypto/elliptic implementations of P-521 and P-384 elliptic curves allow for denial of service (CVE-2019-6486)",
  "Description": "Go before versions 1.10.8 and 1.11.5 has a vulnerability in the\r\ncrypto/elliptic implementations of the P-521 and P-384 elliptic curves.\r\nA remote attacker can exploit this by crafting inputs that consume\r\nexcessive amounts of CPU. These inputs might be delivered via TLS\r\nhandshakes, X.509 certificates, JWT tokens, ECDH shares or ECDSA\r\nsignatures. In some cases, if an ECDH private key is reused more than\r\nonce, the attack can also lead to key recovery.\r\n\r\nh3. Fixed In Version:\r\n\r\ngolang 1.10.8, golang 1.11.5\r\n\r\nh3.
