  "Subject": "[3.9] curl: Multiple vulnerabilities (CVE-2019-5435, CVE-2019-5436)",
  "Description": "h2. CVE-2019-5435: Integer overflows in curl_url_set()\r\n\r\nlibcurl contains two integer overflows in the curl_url_set() function that if triggered, can lead to \r\na too small buffer allocation and a subsequent heap buffer overflow.\r\n\r\nAffected versions: libcurl 7.62.0 to and including 7.64.1\r\nNot affected versions: libcurl \u003c 7.62.0 and \u003e= libcurl 7.65.0\r\n\r\nh3. Reference:\r\n\r\nhttps://curl.haxx.se/docs/CVE-2019-5435.html\r\n\r\nh3. Patch:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/curl/curl/commit/5fc28510a4664f4\r\n\r\nh2. CVE-2019-5436: TFTP receive buffer overflow\r\n\r\nlibcurl contains a heap buffer overflow in the function (tftp_receive_packet()) that recevives data from \r\na TFTP server. It calls recvfrom() with the default size for the buffer rather than with the size that was \r\nused to allocate it. Thus, the content that might overwrite the heap memory is entirely controlled by the server.\r\n\r\nThe flaw exists if the user selects to use a \"blksize\" of 504 or smaller (default is 512). The smaller size that is used, \r\nthe larger the possible overflow becomes. Users chosing a smaller size than default should be rare as the primary \r\nuse case for changing the size is to make it larger.\r\n\r\nAffected versions: libcurl 7.19.4 to and including 7.64.1\r\nNot affected versions: libcurl \u003c 7.19.4 and \u003e= libcurl 7.65.0\r\n\r\nh3. Reference:\r\n\r\nhttps://curl.haxx.se/docs/CVE-2019-5436.html\r\n\r\nh3. Patch:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/curl/curl/commit/2576003415625d7b5f0e390902f8097830b82275\r\n"
