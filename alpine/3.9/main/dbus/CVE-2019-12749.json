  "FixedVersion": "1.10.28-r0",
  "Subject": "[3.9] dbus: DBusServer DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1 authentication bypass (CVE-2019-12749)",
  "Description": "dbus is the reference implementation of D-Bus, an asynchronous\r\ninter-process communication system commonly used for system services\r\nor within a desktop session on Linux and other operating systems.\r\n\r\nJoe Vennix of Apple Information Security discovered an implementation flaw\r\nin the DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1 authentication mechanism. A malicious client with\r\nwrite access to its own home directory could manipulate a ~/.dbus-keyrings\r\nsymlink to cause a DBusServer with a different uid to read and write\r\nin unintended locations. In the worst case, this could result in the\r\nDBusServer reusing a cookie that is known to the malicious client, and\r\ntreating that cookie as evidence that a subsequent client connection\r\ncame from an attacker-chosen uid, allowing authentication bypass.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability does not normally affect the standard system\r\ndbus-daemon, which only allows the EXTERNAL authentication mechanism.\r\nIn supported branches of dbus it also does not normally affect the standard\r\nsession dbus-daemon, for the same reason.\r\n\r\nHowever, this vulnerability can affect third-party users of DBusServer\r\n(such as Upstart in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS), third-party dbus-daemon instances,\r\nstandard dbus-daemon instances with non-standard configuration, and the\r\nsession bus in older/unsupported dbus branches (such as dbus 1.6.x in\r\nUbuntu 14.04 LTS).\r\n\r\nVulnerable versions: all \u003c 1.10.28, 1.12.x \u003c 1.12.16, 1.13.x \u003c 1.13.12\r\nFixed versions: all \u003e= 1.13.12, 1.12.x \u003e= 1.12.16, 1.10.x \u003e= 1.10.28\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.
