  "Description": "There is a vulnerability in the create_with method in Active Record. This\r\nvulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2014-3514.\r\n\r\nVersions Affected: 4.0.0 and All Later Versions.\r\nNot affected: Versions earlier than 4.0.0\r\nFixed Versions: 4.0.9 4.1.5\r\n\r\nImpact\r\n------\r\nThe create_with functionality in Active Record was implemented incorrectly\r\nand completely bypasses the strong parameters protection.
