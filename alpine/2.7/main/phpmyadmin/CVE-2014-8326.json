  "Release": "2.7",
  "Package": "phpmyadmin",
  "Repository": "main",
  "FixedVersion": "4.0.10.7-r0",
  "Subject": "[v2.7] phpmyadmin: xss vulnerabilities (CVE-2014-8326)",
  "Description": "XSS vulnerabilities have been found and fixed in SQL debug output and server monitor page. With a crafted database or table name it is possible to trigger an XSS in SQL debug output when enabled and in server monitor page when viewing and analysing executed queries.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability can be triggered only by someone who is logged in to phpMyAdmin, as the usual token protection prevents non-logged-in users from accessing the required pages. Moreover, debugging SQL is a developer option which is disabled by default and expected to be disabled in production environments.\r\n\r\nAffected Versions: 4.0.x (prior to 4.0.10.5), 4.1.x (prior to 4.1.14.6) and 4.2.x (prior to 4.2.10.1) are affected.\r\n\r\nSolution: upgrade to phpMyAdmin 4.0.10.5 or newer, or 4.1.14.6 or newer, or 4.2.10.1 or newer, or apply the patch could be found by the link below.\r\nhttp://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/security/PMASA-2014-12.php\r\n"
