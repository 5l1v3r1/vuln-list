  "Subject": "[v2.7] qemu: missing field list terminator in vmstate_xhci_event (CVE-2014-5263)",
  "Description": "It was found that vmstate_xhci_event field list was missing VMSTATE_END_OF_LIST() terminator and traversing through this list would result in out-of-bounds access during vm state saving and loading.\r\n\r\nDepending on how vmstate_xhci_event is placed in the qemu binary, this issue can range from non-issue, infinite loop to (potentially) privilege escalation in case the we end up with fields that have info\r\nand/or field_exist members initialized in a way that is useful for exploitation (most probably unlikely).\r\n\r\nIn the worst case, attacker able to alter the migration data could use this flaw to to corrupt QEMU process memory.\r\n\r\nAffected: vmstate_xhci_event was introduced in qemu 1.6 branch. So only Alpine Linux v2.7 and v3.0 are vulnerable. The issue is fixed in v2.0.1.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\nCONFIRM: http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q3/382\r\nCONFIRM: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1126543\r\nCOMMIT: http://git.qemu.org/?p=qemu.git;a=commit;h=3afca1d6d413592c2b78cf28f52fa24a586d8f56\r\n"
