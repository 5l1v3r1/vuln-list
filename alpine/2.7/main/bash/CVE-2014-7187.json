  "Subject": "[v2.7] bash: various unresolved security issues (CVE-2014-7186,CVE-2014-7187,CVE-2014-6277,CVE-2014-6278)",
  "Description": "The Shellshock vulnerability in Bash command line interpreter shell is likely to require more patches, as security researchers continue to unearth further problems in the code. Google security researcher Michal \"lcamtuf\" Zalewski has disclosed that over the past two days he has discovered previously unaddressed issues in the Bash function parser, one of which is as bad as the original Shellshock vulnerability.\r\n\r\nCVE-2014-7186:\r\nIt was discovered that the fixed-sized redir_stack could be forced to overflow in the Bash parser, resulting in memory corruption, and possibly leading to arbitrary code execution when evaluating untrusted input that would not otherwise be run as code.\r\n\r\nCVE-2014-7187:\r\nAn off-by-one error was discovered in the way Bash was handling deeply nested flow control constructs. Depending on the layout of the .bss segment, this could allow arbitrary execution of code that would not otherwise be executed by Bash.\r\n\r\nCVE-2014-6277: bash: untrusted pointer use issue leading to code execution\r\n\r\nCVE-2014-6278: bash: code execution via specially crafted environment variables\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\nDETAILED: http://lcamtuf.blogspot.ro/2014/09/bash-bug-apply-unofficial-patch-now.html\r\nhttp://www.itnews.com.au/News/396256,further-flaws-render-shellshock-patch-ineffective.aspx\r\nPATCH: http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/09/25/13\r\nPATCH: http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-4.3-patches/bash43-027\r\nhttp://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q3/735\r\nhttps://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7186\r\nhttps://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-7187\r\nhttps://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-6277\r\nhttps://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-6278\r\n"
