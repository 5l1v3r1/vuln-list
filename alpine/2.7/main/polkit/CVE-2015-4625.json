  "Release": "2.7",
  "Package": "polkit",
  "Repository": "main",
  "FixedVersion": "0.105-r3",
  "Subject": "[v2.7] polkit: cookie generator can wrap and two identical cookies could exist; DoS (CVE-2015-4625)",
  "Description": "The \"cookie\" value that Polkit hands out is global to all polkit\r\nusers. And when `AuthenticationAgentResponse` is invoked, we\r\npreviously only received the cookie and target identity, and attempted\r\nto find an agent from that.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the current cookie is just an integer\r\ncounter, and if it overflowed, it would be possible for\r\nan successful authorization in one session to trigger a response\r\nin another session.\r\n\r\nReference:\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4625\r\nhttps://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=90837\r\n"
