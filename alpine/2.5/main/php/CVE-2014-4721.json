  "FixedVersion": "5.3.28-r6",
  "Subject": "[v2.5] php: sensitive information leak from process memory (CVE-2014-4721)",
  "Description": "The phpinfo implementation in ext/standard/info.c in PHP before 5.4.30 and 5.5.x before 5.5.14 does not ensure use of the string data type for the PHP_AUTH_PW, PHP_AUTH_TYPE, PHP_AUTH_USER, and PHP_SELF variables, which might allow context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory by using the integer data type with crafted values, related to a \"type confusion\" vulnerability, as demonstrated by reading a private SSL key in an Apache HTTP Server web-hosting environment with mod_ssl and a PHP 5.3.x mod_php.\r\n\r\n•MISC: http://twitter.com/mikispag/statuses/485713462258302976 \r\n•MISC: https://www.sektioneins.de/en/blog/14-07-04-phpinfo-infoleak.html \r\n•CONFIRM: http://www.php.net/ChangeLog-5.php \r\n•CONFIRM: https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=67498\r\n"
