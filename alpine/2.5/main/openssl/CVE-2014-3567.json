  "Description": "OpenSSL Security Advisory [15 Oct 2014]\r\n=======================================\r\n\r\nSRTP Memory Leak (CVE-2014-3513)\r\n================================\r\n\r\nSeverity: High\r\n\r\nA flaw in the DTLS SRTP extension parsing code allows an attacker, who\r\nsends a carefully crafted handshake message, to cause OpenSSL to fail\r\nto free up to 64k of memory causing a memory leak. This could be\r\nexploited in a Denial Of Service attack. This issue affects OpenSSL\r\n1.0.1 server implementations for both SSL/TLS and DTLS regardless of\r\nwhether SRTP is used or configured. Implementations of OpenSSL that\r\nhave been compiled with OPENSSL_NO_SRTP defined are not affected.\r\n\r\nOpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1j.\r\n\r\nThis issue was reported to OpenSSL on 26th September 2014, based on an original\r\nissue and patch developed by the LibreSSL project. Further analysis of the issue\r\nwas performed by the OpenSSL team.\r\n\r\nThe fix was developed by the OpenSSL team.\r\n\r\n\r\nSession Ticket Memory Leak (CVE-2014-3567)\r\n==========================================\r\n\r\nSeverity: Medium\r\n\r\nWhen an OpenSSL SSL/TLS/DTLS server receives a session ticket the\r\nintegrity of that ticket is first verified. In the event of a session\r\nticket integrity check failing, OpenSSL will fail to free memory\r\ncausing a memory leak. By sending a large number of invalid session\r\ntickets an attacker could exploit this issue in a Denial Of Service\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nOpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1j.\r\nOpenSSL 1.0.0 users should upgrade to 1.0.0o.\r\nOpenSSL 0.9.8 users should upgrade to 0.9.8zc. \r\n\r\nThis issue was reported to OpenSSL on 8th October 2014.\r\n\r\nThe fix was developed by Stephen Henson of the OpenSSL core team.\r\n\r\n\r\nSSL 3.0 Fallback protection\r\n===========================\r\n\r\nSeverity: Medium\r\n\r\nOpenSSL has added support for TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV to allow applications\r\nto block the ability for a MITM attacker to force a protocol\r\ndowngrade.\r\n\r\nSome client applications (such as browsers) will reconnect using a\r\ndowngraded protocol to work around interoperability bugs in older\r\nservers. This could be exploited by an active man-in-the-middle to\r\ndowngrade connections to SSL 3.0 even if both sides of the connection\r\nsupport higher protocols. SSL 3.0 contains a number of weaknesses\r\nincluding POODLE (CVE-2014-3566).\r\n\r\nOpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1j.\r\nOpenSSL 1.0.0 users should upgrade to 1.0.0o.\r\nOpenSSL 0.9.8 users should upgrade to 0.9.8zc. \r\n\r\nhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-downgrade-scsv-00\r\nhttps://www.openssl.org/~bodo/ssl-poodle.pdf\r\n\r\nSupport for TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV was developed by Adam Langley and Bodo Moeller.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuild option no-ssl3 is incomplete (CVE-2014-3568)\r\n==================================================\r\n\r\nSeverity: Low\r\n\r\nWhen OpenSSL is configured with \"no-ssl3\" as a build option, servers\r\ncould accept and complete a SSL 3.0 handshake, and clients could be\r\nconfigured to send them.\r\n\r\nOpenSSL 1.0.1 users should upgrade to 1.0.1j.\r\nOpenSSL 1.0.0 users should upgrade to 1.0.0o.\r\nOpenSSL 0.9.8 users should upgrade to 0.9.8zc. \r\n\r\nThis issue was reported to OpenSSL by Akamai Technologies on 14th October 2014.\r\n\r\nThe fix was developed by Akamai and the OpenSSL team.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n==========\r\n\r\nURL for this Security Advisory:\r\nhttps://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20141015.txt\r\n\r\nNote: the online version of the advisory may be updated with additional\r\ndetails over time.\r\n\r\nFor details of OpenSSL severity classifications please see:\r\nhttps://www.openssl.org/about/secpolicy.html\r\n\r\n"
