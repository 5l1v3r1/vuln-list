  "Release": "2.6",
  "Package": "tiff",
  "Repository": "main",
  "FixedVersion": "4.0.3-r1",
  "Subject": "[v2.6] Multiple security issues in libtiff (CVE-2013-1960 , CVE-2013-1961)",
  "Description": "references:\r\nhttps://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-1960\r\nhttps://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2013-1961\r\n\r\nTwo flaws were reported to us in tiff2pdf utility shipped with the\r\nlibtiff library. Details as follows:\r\n\r\n1. CVE-2013-1961 libtiff (tiff2pdf): Stack-based buffer overflow with\r\nmalformed image-length and resolution\r\n\r\nA stack-based buffer overflow was found in the way tiff2pdf, a TIFF\r\nimage to a PDF document conversion tool, of libtiff, a library of\r\nfunctions for manipulating TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) image format\r\nfiles, performed write of TIFF image content into particular PDF\r\ndocument file, when malformed image-length and resolution values are\r\nused in the TIFF file. A remote attacker could provide a specially-\r\ncrafted TIFF image format file, that when processed by tiff2pdf would\r\nlead to tiff2pdf executable crash.\r\n\r\nReference: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=952131\r\n\r\n2.  CVE-2013-1960 libtiff (tiff2pdf): Heap-based buffer overflow in\r\nt2_process_jpeg_strip()\r\n\r\nA heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way tiff2pdf, a TIFF\r\nimage to a PDF document conversion tool, of libtiff, a library of\r\nfunctions for manipulating TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) image format\r\nfiles, performed write of TIFF image content into particular PDF\r\ndocument file, in the tp_process_jpeg_strip() function. A remote\r\nattacker could provide a specially-crafted TIFF image format file, that\r\nwhen processed by tiff2pdf would lead to tiff2pdf executable crash or,\r\npotentially, arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user\r\nrunning the tiff2pdf binary.\r\n\r\nReference: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=952158\r\n"
