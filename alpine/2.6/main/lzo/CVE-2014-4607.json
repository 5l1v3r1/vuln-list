  "Subject": "[v2.6] lzo: potential integer overflow (CVE-2014-4607)",
  "Description": "LZO 2.07: Fixed a potential integer overflow condition in the \"safe\" decompressor variants which could result in a possible buffer overrun when processing maliciously crafted compressed input data.\r\n\r\nComments from http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/lzo/:\r\n\r\n_Fortunately this issue only affects 32-bit systems and also can only happen if you use uncommonly huge buffer sizes where you have to decompress more than 16 MiB (\u003e 2^24 bytes) untrusted compressed bytes within a single function call, so the practical implications are limited.\r\n\r\nAlso I personally do not know about any client program that uses such a huge logical block size and actually is affected.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: the Linux kernel is not affected; media hype._\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\nhttp://www.mail-archive.com/debian-bugs-dist@lists.debian.org/msg1232291.html\r\nhttps://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1112418\r\n"
