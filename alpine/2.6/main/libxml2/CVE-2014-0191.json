  "Subject": "[v2.6] libxml2: do not fetch external parameter entities (CVE-2014-0191)",
  "Description": "It was discovered that libxml2, a library providing support to read, modify and write XML files, incorrectly performs entity substituton in the doctype prolog, even if the application using libxml2 disabled any entity substitution. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted XML file that, when processed, would lead to the exhaustion of CPU and memory resources or file descriptors.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\nhttp://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0191\r\nhttp://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/05/06/4\r\nhttp://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-2214-1\r\nCOMMIT: https://git.gnome.org/browse/libxml2/commit/?id=9cd1c3cfbd32655d60572c0a413e017260c854df\r\n"
