  "IssueID": 2588,
  "VulnerabilityID": "CVE-2013-6462",
  "Release": "2.6",
  "Package": "libxfont",
  "Repository": "main",
  "FixedVersion": "1.4.7-r0",
  "Subject": "[v2.6] libxfont: Stack buffer overflow in parsing of BDF font files (CVE-2013-6462)",
  "Description": "Scanning of the libXfont sources with the cppcheck static analyzer\r\nincluded a report of:\r\n [lib/libXfont/src/bitmap/bdfread.c:341]: (warning)\r\n scanf without field width limits can crash with huge input data.\r\nEvaluation of this report by X.Org developers concluded that a BDF font\r\nfile containing a longer than expected string could overflow the buffer\r\non the stack. Testing in X servers built with Stack Protector resulted\r\nin an immediate crash when reading a user-provided specially crafted font.\r\n\r\nAs libXfont is used to read user-specified font files in all X servers\r\ndistributed by X.Org, including the Xorg server which is often run with\r\nroot privileges or as setuid-root in order to access hardware, this bug\r\nmay lead to an unprivileged user acquiring root privileges in some systems.\r\n\r\nAffected Versions =================\r\n\r\nThis bug appears to have been introduced in the initial RCS version 1.1\r\nchecked in on 1991/05/10, and is thus believed to be present in every X11\r\nrelease starting with X11R5 up to the current libXfont 1.4.6.\r\n(Manual inspection shows it is present in the sources from the X11R5 \r\ntarballs, but not in those from the X11R4 tarballs.)\r\n\r\nFixes =====\r\n\r\nA fix is available via the attached patch, which is also included in \r\nlibXfont 1.4.7, released today, and available in the libXfont git repo:\r\nhttp://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libXfont/commit/?id=4d024ac10f964f6bd372ae0dd14f02772a6e5f63\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\nhttp://lists.x.org/archives/xorg-announce/2014-January/002389.html\r\nhttp://seclists.org/bugtraq/2014/Jan/15\r\n"
