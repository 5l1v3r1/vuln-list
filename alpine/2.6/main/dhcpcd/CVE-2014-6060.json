  "Repository": "main",
  "FixedVersion": "5.6.8-r1",
  "Subject": "[v2.6] dhcpcd: DHO_OPTIONSOVERLOADED option related issue (CVE-2014-6060)",
  "Description": "As reported by Tobias Stoeckmann:\r\nIn function get_option, the DHO_OPTIONSOVERLOADED option checks if there are overloaded options, like bootfile or servername. It tries to make sure that it's called only once, BUT overwrites that information after receiving a DHO_END. A malicious server could set the option DHO_OPTIONSOVERLOADED yet another time in the bootfile or servername section, which will result in another jump -- maybe into the same area.\r\n\r\ndhcpcd-4.0.0 through 6.4.2 are vulnerable. dhcpcd-6.4.3 has been released with the above fix.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\nCONFIRM: http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2014/q3/483\r\nCOMMIT: http://roy.marples.name/projects/dhcpcd/ci/1d2b93aa5ce25a8a710082fe2d36a6bf7f5794d5?sbs=0\r\n"
