  "Release": "2.6",
  "Package": "libarchive",
  "Repository": "main",
  "FixedVersion": "3.1.2-r1",
  "Subject": "[2.6] Vulnerability in libarchive allow remote code execution (CVE-2013-0211)",
  "Description": "A vulnerability has been found and corrected in libarchive:\r\n\r\n Fabian Yamaguchi reported a read buffer overflow flaw in\r\n libarchive on 64-bit systems where sizeof(size_t) is equal\r\n to 8. In the archive_write_zip_data() function in libarchive/\r\n archive_write_set_format_zip.c, the \u0026quot;s\u0026quot; parameter is of type size_t\r\n (64 bit, unsigned) and is cast to a 64 bit signed integer. If \u0026quot;s\u0026quot; is\r\n larger than MAX_INT, it will not be set to \u0026quot;zip-\u0026gt;remaining_data_bytes\u0026quot;\r\n even though it is larger than \u0026quot;zip-\u0026gt;remaining_data_bytes\u0026quot;, which\r\n leads to a buffer overflow when calling deflate(). This can lead to a\r\n segfault in an application that uses libarchive to create ZIP archives\r\n (CVE-2013-0211).\r\n\r\nhttps://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=902998\r\nhttps://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/commit/22531545514043e04633e1c015c7540b9de9dbe4.patch"
