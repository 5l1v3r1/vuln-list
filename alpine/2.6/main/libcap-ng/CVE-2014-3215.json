  "Subject": "[v2.6] libcap-ng: capng_lock sets securebits in a scary manner (CVE-2014-3215)",
  "Description": "capng_lock sets securebits in an attempt to prevent regaining capabilities using setuid-root programs. This works, but it has little effect on setcap'd programs, and it allows a user to run setuid programs as uid 0 but without capabilities, which is potentially dangerous.\r\n\r\nseunshare in policycoreutils 2.2.5 is owned by root with 4755 permissions, and executes programs in a way that changes the relationship between the setuid system call and the getresuid saved set-user-ID value, which makes it easier for local users to gain privileges by leveraging a program that mistakenly expected that it could permanently drop privileges.\r\n\r\n•MLIST:[oss-security] 20140429 local privilege escalation due to capng_lock as used in seunshare \r\n•URL: http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/04/29/7 \r\n•MLIST:[oss-security] 20140430 Re: local privilege escalation due to capng_lock as used in seunshare \r\n•URL: http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/04/30/4 \r\n•MLIST:[oss-security] 20140507 Re: local privilege escalation due to capng_lock as used in seunshare \r\n•URL: http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/05/08/1 \r\n•BID:67341 \r\n•URL: http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/67341 \r\n•SECUNIA:59007 \r\n•URL: http://secunia.com/advisories/59007\r\n"
