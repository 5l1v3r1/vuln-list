  "Package": "libvirt",
  "Repository": "main",
  "FixedVersion": "1.0.5-r1",
  "Subject": "[2.6]libvirt: DoS (max count of open files exhaustion) due sockets leak in the storage pool (CVE-2013-1962)",
  "Description": "A denial of service flaw was found in the way storage pool manager of\r\nlibvirt, a C toolkit to interact with the virtualization capabilities of\r\nrecent versions of Linux (and other OSes), performed management of\r\nsocket file descriptors when 'to list all volumes for the particular\r\npool' request was issued (two socket file descriptors were leaked per\r\n\"list all pool volumes\" request). An uprivileged user could use this\r\nflaw to cause denial of service (make libvirtd daemon to exhaust / reach\r\nthe maximum count of open file descriptors, the libvirtd daemon process\r\nwas allowed to open, possibly preventing other users from use of\r\nlibvirtd services till the libvirtd daemon was restarted).\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\nhttps://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2013-1962\r\n\r\nUpstream patch:\r\nhttps://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2013-May/msg01222.html"
