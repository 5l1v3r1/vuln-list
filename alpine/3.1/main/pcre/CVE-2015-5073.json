  "Description": "PCRE library is prone to a vulnerability which leads to Heap Overflow. \r\nDuring subpattern calculation of a malformed regular expression, an offset that is used as an array index is fully controlled and can be large enough so that unexpected heap memory regions are accessed. \r\nOne could at least exploit this issue to read objects nearby of the affected application's memory. \r\nSuch information disclosure may also be used to bypass memory protection method such as ASLR.\r\n\r\nReference:\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://bugs.exim.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1651\r\n"
