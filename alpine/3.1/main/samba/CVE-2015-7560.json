  "Subject": "[3.1] samba: security issues (CVE-2015-7560, CVE-2016-0771)",
  "Description": "h3. CVE-2015-7560 Incorrect ACL get/set allowed on symlink path\r\n\r\nAll versions of Samba from 3.2.0 to 4.4.0rc3 inclusive are vulnerable to\r\na malicious client overwriting the ownership of ACLs using symlinks.\r\n\r\nAn authenticated malicious client can use SMB1 UNIX extensions to\r\ncreate a symlink to a file or directory, and then use non-UNIX SMB1\r\ncalls to overwrite the contents of the ACL on the file or directory\r\nlinked to.\r\n\r\nUpdate to *4.1.23 or 4.2.9*\r\n\r\nh3. References:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2015-7560.html\r\n\r\nh3. CVE-2016-0771:  Out-of-bounds read in internal DNS server\r\n\r\nAll versions of Samba from 4.0.0 to 4.4.0rc2 inclusive, when deployed as an AD DC and\r\nchoose to run the internal DNS server, are vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read issue\r\nduring DNS TXT record handling caused by users with permission to modify DNS records.\r\n\r\nA malicious client can upload a specially constructed DNS TXT record, resulting in a \r\nremote denial-of-service attack. As long as the affected TXT record remains undisturbed\r\nin the Samba database, a targeted DNS query may continue to trigger this exploit.\r\n\r\nWhile unlikely, the out-of-bounds read may bypass safety checks and allow leakage \r\nof memory from the server in the form of a DNS TXT reply.\r\n\r\nUpdate to *4.1.23 or 4.2.9*\r\n\r\nh3.
