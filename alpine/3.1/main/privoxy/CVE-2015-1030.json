  "FixedVersion": "3.0.23-r0",
  "Subject": "[v3.1] privoxy: multiple fixes (CVE-2015-1030, CVE-2015-1031 etc.)",
  "Description": "Privoxy 3.0.23 stable is a bug-fix release, but some of the fixed bugs are security issues (CVE requests pending).\r\nAlpine branches are from 3.0.21 to 3.0.22 at the moment and should be upgraded to 3.0.23.\r\nâ€¢Version 3.0.23 stable ***\r\n- Bug fixes:\r\n - Fixed a DoS issue in case of client requests with incorrect chunk-encoded body. When compiled with assertions enabled (the default) they could previously cause Privoxy to abort(). Reported by Matthew Daley.\r\n - Fixed multiple segmentation faults and memory leaks in the pcrs code. This fix also increases the chances that an invalid pcrs command is rejected as such. Previously some invalid commands would be loaded without error. Note that Privoxy's pcrs sources (action and filter files) are considered trustworthy input and should not be writable by untrusted third-parties.\r\n - Fixed an 'invalid read' bug which could at least theoretically cause Privoxy to crash. So far, no crashes have been observed.\r\n - Compiles with --disable-force again. Reported by Kai Raven.\r\n - Client requests with body that can't be delivered no longer cause pipelined requests behind them to be rejected as invalid. Reported by Basil Hussain.\r\n\r\nSome of the issues fixed in 3.0.22 (actual for Alpine Linux v2.6 up to v3.0) are CVE-2015-1030 and CVE-2015-1031.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\nhttp://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q1/111\r\nhttps://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-1030\r\nhttp://www.privoxy.org/announce.txt\r\n"
