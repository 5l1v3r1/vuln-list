  "Repository": "main",
  "FixedVersion": "2.11.1-r2",
  "Subject": "[3.1] fontconfig: Possible double free due to insufficiently validated cache files (CVE-2016-5384)",
  "Description": "It was reported that offsets contained in cache files aren't checked if they're in legal ranges or are pointers at all. \r\nThe lack of validation allows an attacker to trigger arbitrary free() calls, which in turn allows double free attacks \r\nand therefore arbitrary code execution. When used with setuid binaries using crafted cachefiles, privilege escalation is possible.\r\n\r\nh3. Reference:\r\n\r\nhttps://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/fontconfig/2016-August/005792.html\r\n\r\n\r\nh3.
