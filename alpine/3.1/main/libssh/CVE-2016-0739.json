  "FixedVersion": "0.6.5-r0",
  "Subject": "[3.1] libssh: bits/bytes confusion resulting in truncated Difffie-Hellman secret length (CVE-2016-0739)",
  "Description": "libssh versions 0.1 and above have a bits/bytes confusion bug and generate the\r\nan anormaly short ephemeral secret for the diffie-hellman-group1 and\r\ndiffie-hellman-group14 key exchange methods.\r\nThe resulting secret is 128 bits long, instead of the recommended sizes of 1024\r\nand 2048 bits respectively. There are practical algorithms (Baby steps/Giant\r\nsteps, Pollard's rho) that can solve this problem in O(2^63) operations.\r\n\r\nh3. Fixed In Version: \t\r\n\r\nlibssh 0.7.3\r\n\r\nh3.
