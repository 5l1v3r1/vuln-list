  "FixedVersion": "1.7.3.0-r0",
  "Subject": "[v3.1] socat: DoS with fork (CVE-2015-1379)",
  "Description": "Socat security advisory 6 - Possible DoS with fork\r\n\r\nOverview\r\n socats signal handler implementations are not async-signal-safe and can cause crash or freeze of socat processes.\r\n\r\nSeverity: Low\r\n\r\nDetails\r\nSocats signal handler implementations are not asnyc-signal-safe. When a signal is triggered while the process is within a non async-signal-safe function the signal handler will call a non async-signal-safe function too. POSIX specifies the behaviour in this situation as undefined. Dependend on involved functions, libraries, and operating system, the process can continue, freeze, or crash. Mostly this issue occurs when socat is in listening mode with fork option and a couple of child processes terminate at the same time.\r\n\r\nAffected versions\r\n 1.0.0.0 - 1.7.2.4\r\n 2.0.0-b1 - 2.0.0-b7\r\n\r\nNot affected or corrected versions\r\n 1.7.3.0 and later\r\n 2.0.0-b8 (to be released) and later\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\nhttp://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q1/284\r\nhttps://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1379\r\nCONFIRM: http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/contrib/socat-secadv6.txt\r\n"
