  "Release": "3.1",
  "Package": "curl",
  "Repository": "main",
  "FixedVersion": "7.49.1-r2",
  "Subject": "[3.1] curl: Incorrect reuse of client certificates (CVE-2016-7141)",
  "Description": "libcurl built on top of NSS (Network Security Services) incorrectly re-used client certificates if a \r\ncertificate from file was used for one TLS connection but no certificate set for a subsequent TLS connection.\r\n\r\nWhile the symptoms are similar to CVE-2016-5420 (Re-using connection with wrong client cert), \r\nthis vulnerability was caused by an implementation detail of the NSS backend in libcurl, which is orthogonal to the cause of CVE-2016-5420.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Affected versions: \r\n\r\nlibcurl 7.19.6 to and including 7.50.1\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. Reference:\r\n\r\nhttps://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20160907.html\r\n\r\nh3. Patch:\r\n\r\nhttps://curl.haxx.se/CVE-2016-7141.patch\r\n"
