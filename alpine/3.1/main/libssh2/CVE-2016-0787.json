  "VulnerabilityID": "CVE-2016-0787",
  "Release": "3.1",
  "Package": "libssh2",
  "Repository": "main",
  "FixedVersion": "1.4.3-r1",
  "Subject": "[3.1] libssh2: Wrong calculation of Diffie Helllman secret length (CVE-2016-0787)",
  "Description": "During the SSHv2 handshake when libssh2 is to get a suitable value for 'group order' in the Diffle Hellman negotiation,\r\n it would pass in number of bytes to a function that expected number of bits. This would result in the library generating \r\nnumbers using only an 8th the number of random bits than what were intended: 128 or 256 bits instead of 1023 or 2047\r\n\r\nUsing such drastically reduced amount of random bits for Diffie Hellman weakended the handshake security significantly.\r\n\r\nh3. Affected versions: \r\n\r\nall versions to and including 1.6.0\r\n\r\nh3. Fixed In Version: \t\r\n\r\nlibssh2 1.7.0\r\n\r\nh3. References:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.libssh2.org/adv_20160223.html\r\n\r\nh3. Patch:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.libssh2.org/CVE-2016-0787.patch"
