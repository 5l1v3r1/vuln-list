  "FixedVersion": "1.8.15-r0",
  "Subject": "[3.1] sudo: Unauthorized privilege escalation in sudoedit (CVE-2015-5602)",
  "Description": "An unauthorized privilege escalation was found in sudoedit when a user is granted with\r\nroot access to modify a particular file that could be located in a subset of directories. \r\nIt seems that sudoedit does not check the full path if a wildcard is used twice (e.g. /home/*/*/file.txt),\r\nallowing a malicious user to replace the file.txt real file with a symbolic link to a different location \r\n(e.g. /etc/shadow), which results into unauthorized access. Affected versions are \u003c= 1.8.14.\r\n\r\n\r\nh3. References:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.sudo.ws/stable.html#1.8.15\r\nhttps://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2015-5602\r\n\r\nh3.
