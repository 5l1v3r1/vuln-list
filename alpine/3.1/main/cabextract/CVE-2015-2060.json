  "Package": "cabextract",

  "FixedVersion": "1.6-r0",
  "Subject": "[v3.1] cabextract: directory traversal with UTF-8 symbols in filenames (CVE-2015-2060)",
  "Description": "It was reported that cabextract is susceptible to a directory traversal vulnerability. While extracting files from an archive, it removes leading slashes from filenames but does it before possibly decoding UTF-8 and doesn't check for invalid UTF-8. Hence an absolute filename can be shoved through by using overlong encoding for the leading slash (and setting utf8 attribute in the header). This can be exploited by a malicious archive to write files outside the current directory.\r\n\r\nThe issue was reported to Stuart Caie today and fixed in less than 4h.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\nCONFIRM: http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q1/671\r\nCONFIRM: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1193952\r\nPATCH: http://sourceforge.net/p/libmspack/code/217/\r\n"
