  "description": "Package updates are available for Amazon Linux AMI that fix the following vulnerabilities:\nCVE-2019-13638:\n\t99999: \nCVE-2019-13638 patch: OS shell command injection when processing crafted patch files\nGNU patch through 2.7.6 is vulnerable to OS shell command injection that can be exploited by opening a crafted patch file that contains an ed style diff payload with shell metacharacters. The ed editor does not need to be present on the vulnerable system. This is different from CVE-2018-1000156.\n\nCVE-2018-20969:\n\t99999: \nCVE-2018-20969 patch: do_ed_script in pch.c does not block strings beginning with a ! character\ndo_ed_script in pch.c in GNU patch through 2.7.6 does not block strings beginning with a ! character. NOTE: this is the same commit as for CVE-2019-13638, but the ! syntax is specific to ed, and is unrelated to a shell metacharacter.\n",
