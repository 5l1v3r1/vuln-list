      "Text": "This update for nginx fixes the following issues:\n\nnginx was updated to 1.14.2:\n\n- Bugfix: nginx could not be built on Fedora 28 Linux.\n- Bugfix: in handling of client addresses when using unix domain\n  listen sockets to work with datagrams on Linux.\n- Change: the logging level of the \u0026quot;http request\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;https proxy\n  request\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;unsupported protocol\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;version too low\u0026quot;,\n  \u0026quot;no suitable key share\u0026quot;, and \u0026quot;no suitable signature algorithm\u0026quot;\n  SSL errors has been lowered from \u0026quot;crit\u0026quot; to \u0026quot;info\u0026quot;.\n- Bugfix: when using OpenSSL 1.1.0 or newer it was not possible\n  to switch off \u0026quot;ssl_prefer_server_ciphers\u0026quot; in a virtual server\n  if it was switched on in the default server.\n- Bugfix: nginx could not be built with LibreSSL 2.8.0.\n- Bugfix: if nginx was built with OpenSSL 1.1.0 and used with\n  OpenSSL 1.1.1, the TLS 1.3 protocol was always enabled.\n- Bugfix: sending a disk-buffered request body to a gRPC backend\n  might fail.\n- Bugfix: connections with some gRPC backends might not be cached when\n  using the \u0026quot;keepalive\u0026quot; directive.\n- Bugfix: a segmentation fault might occur in a worker process if the\n  ngx_http_mp4_module was used on 32-bit platforms.\n\nChanges with nginx 1.14.1:\n\n- Security: when using HTTP/2 a client might cause excessive memory\n  consumption (CVE-2018-16843) and CPU usage (CVE-2018-16844).\n- Security: processing of a specially crafted mp4 file with the\n  ngx_http_mp4_module might result in worker process memory disclosure\n  (CVE-2018-16845).\n- Bugfix: working with gRPC backends might result in excessive memory\n  consumption.\n\nChanges with nginx 1.13.12:\n\n- Bugfix: connections with gRPC backends might be closed unexpectedly\n  when returning a large response.\n\nChanges with nginx 1.13.10\n\n- Feature: the \u0026quot;set\u0026quot; parameter of the \u0026quot;include\u0026quot; SSI \n  directive now allows writing arbitrary responses to a\n  variable; the \u0026quot;subrequest_output_buffer_size\u0026quot; directive\n  defines maximum response size.\n- Feature: now nginx uses clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC) if available,\n  to avoid timeouts being incorrectly triggered on system time changes.\n- Feature: the \u0026quot;escape=none\u0026quot; parameter of the \u0026quot;log_format\u0026quot; directive.\n  Thanks to Johannes Baiter and Calin Don.\n- Feature: the $ssl_preread_alpn_protocols variable in the\n  ngx_stream_ssl_preread_module.\n- Feature: the ngx_http_grpc_module.\n- Bugfix: in memory allocation error handling in the \u0026quot;geo\u0026quot; directive.\n- Bugfix: when using variables in the \u0026quot;auth_basic_user_file\u0026quot; directive\n  a null character might appear in logs.\n  Thanks to Vadim Filimonov.\n\n",

The issue only affects nginx if it is built with the ngx_http_mp4_module (the module is not built by default) and the .mp4. directive is used in the configuration file.
