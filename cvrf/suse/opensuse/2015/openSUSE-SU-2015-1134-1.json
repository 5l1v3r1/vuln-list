(boo#933109)\n* CVE-2015-0848: An attacker that could trick a victim into opening a specially crafted WMF file in a libwmf based application could have executed arbitrary code through incorrect run-length encoding. (boo#933109)\n* CVE-2009-1364: Use-after-free vulnerability in the embedded GD library in libwmf allowed context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted WMF file. (boo#495842, boo#831299)\n\nThe following non-security bug was fixed:\n\n* boo#892356: Make libwmf-tools not depend on libwmf-devel",
