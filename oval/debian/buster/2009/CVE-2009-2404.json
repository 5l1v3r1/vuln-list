The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\nMoxie Marlinspike discovered that a buffer overflow in the regular\n   expression parser could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\nDan Kaminsky discovered that NULL characters in certificate\n   names could lead to man-in-the-middle attacks by tricking the user\n   into accepting a rogue certificate.\nCertificates with MD2 hash signatures are no longer accepted\n   since they're no longer considered cryptograhically secure.\nThe old stable distribution (etch) doesn't contain nss.\n"
