      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-1834\nA denial of service flaw was found in the Apache mod_proxy module when\nit was used as a reverse proxy. A remote attacker could use this flaw\nto force a proxy process to consume large amounts of CPU time. This\nissue did not affect Debian 4.0 \"etch\".\nA denial of service flaw was found in the Apache mod_deflate module.\nThis module continued to compress large files until compression was\ncomplete, even if the network connection that requested the content\nwas closed before compression completed. This would cause mod_deflate\nto consume large amounts of CPU if mod_deflate was enabled for a large\nfile. A similar flaw related to HEAD requests for compressed content\nwas also fixed.\nThe oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in\nversion 2.2.3-4+etch9.\n"
