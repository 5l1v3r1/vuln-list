This could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\nJan Minar discovered that the tar plugin of vim did not properly\n    sanitise the filenames in the tar archive or the name of the\n    archive file itself, making it prone to arbitrary code execution.\nJan Minar discovered that the zip plugin of vim did not properly\n    sanitise the filenames in the zip archive or the name of the\n    archive file itself, making it prone to arbitrary code execution.\nJan Minar discovered that the netrw plugin of vim did not properly\n    sanitise the filenames or directory names it is given. This could\n    lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\nBen Schmidt discovered that vim did not properly escape characters\n    when performing keyword or tag lookups. This could lead to the\n    execution of arbitrary code.\n"
