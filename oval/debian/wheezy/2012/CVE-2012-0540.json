      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2496\n\n   Due to the non-disclosure of security patch information from Oracle,\n   we are forced to ship an upstream version update of MySQL 5.1.\n   There are several known incompatible\n   changes, which are listed in /usr/share/doc/mysql-server/NEWS.Debian.gz.\n\nSeveral issues have been discovered in the MySQL database server. The\nvulnerabilities are addressed by upgrading MySQL to a new upstream\nversion, 5.1.63, which includes additional changes, such as performance\nimprovements and corrections for data loss defects.  These changes are\ndescribed in the \u003ca href=\"http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/news-5-1-x.html\"\u003eMySQL\nrelease notes\u003c/a\u003e.\n\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-2122\"\u003eCVE-2012-2122\u003c/a\u003e,\nan authentication bypass vulnerability, occurs only when\nMySQL has been built in with certain optimisations enabled. The packages\nin Debian stable (squeeze) are not known to be affected by this\nvulnerability. It is addressed in this update nonetheless, so future\nrebuilds will not become vulnerable to this issue.\n",
