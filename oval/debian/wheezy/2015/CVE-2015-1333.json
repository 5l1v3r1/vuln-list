      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3329\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel\nthat may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or\ninformation leak.\nColin Ian King discovered a flaw in the add_key function of the\n    Linux kernel's keyring subsystem. A local user can exploit this flaw\n    to cause a denial of service due to memory exhaustion.\nJi Jianwen of Red Hat Engineering discovered a flaw in the handling\n    of the SCTPs automatic handling of dynamic multi-homed connections.\n    A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a crash or potentially\n    for privilege escalation.\nA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the\n    kvm_apic_has_events function in the KVM subsystem. A unprivileged\n    local user could exploit this flaw to crash the system kernel\n    resulting in denial of service.\nDaniel Borkmann discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel implementation\n    of the Berkeley Packet Filter which can be used by a local user to\n    crash the system.\nIt was discovered that the Linux kernel does not properly handle\n    invalid UDP checksums. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to\n    cause a denial of service using a flood of UDP packets with invalid\n    checksums.\nIt was discovered that the Linux kernel does not properly handle\n    invalid UDP checksums. A remote attacker can cause a denial of\n    service against applications that use epoll by injecting a single\n    packet with an invalid checksum.\nA flaw was discovered in the md driver in the Linux kernel leading\n    to an information leak.\nAn user triggerable use-after-free vulnerability in path lookup in\n    the Linux kernel could potentially lead to privilege escalation.\nAn integer overflow in the SCSI generic driver in the Linux kernel\n    was discovered. A local user with write permission on a SCSI generic\n    device could potentially exploit this flaw for privilege escalation.\n",
