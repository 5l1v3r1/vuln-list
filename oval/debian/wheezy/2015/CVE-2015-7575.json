In addition\nthe bundled NSS crypto library addresses the SLOTH attack on TLS 1.2.\nDSA-3436\nKarthikeyan Bhargavan and Gaetan Leurent at INRIA discovered a flaw in\nthe TLS 1.2 protocol which could allow the MD5 hash function to be used\nfor signing ServerKeyExchange and Client Authentication packets during a\nTLS handshake. A man-in-the-middle attacker could exploit this flaw to\nconduct collision attacks to impersonate a TLS server or an\nauthenticated TLS client.\nMore information can be found at\n\u003ca href='https://www.mitls.org/pages/attacks/SLOTH'\u003e\\\nhttps://www.mitls.org/pages/attacks/SLOTH\u003c/a\u003e\nDSA-3465\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJDK, an\nimplementation of the Oracle Java platform, resulting in breakouts of\nthe Java sandbox, information disclosure, denial of service and insecure\ncryptography.\nDSA-3458\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJDK, an\nimplementation of the Oracle Java platform, resulting in breakouts of\nthe Java sandbox, information disclosur, denial of service and insecure\ncryptography.\nDSA-3437\nKarthikeyan Bhargavan and Gaetan Leurent at INRIA discovered a flaw in\nthe TLS 1.2 protocol which could allow the MD5 hash function to be used\nfor signing ServerKeyExchange and Client Authentication packets during a\nTLS handshake.
