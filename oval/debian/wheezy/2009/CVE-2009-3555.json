      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2626\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in the TLS/SSL protocol. This\nupdate addresses these protocol vulnerabilities in lighttpd.\nMarsh Ray, Steve Dispensa, and Martin Rex discovered that the TLS\n  and SSLv3 protocols do not properly associate renegotiation\n  handshakes with an existing connection, which allows man-in-the-middle\n  attackers to insert data into HTTPS sessions. This issue is solved\n  in lighttpd by disabling client initiated renegotiation by default.\n\n  \n  Those users that do actually need such renegotiations, can reenable\n  them via the new \u003cq\u003essl.disable-client-renegotiation\u003c/q\u003e parameter.\nJuliano Rizzo and Thai Duong discovered a weakness in the TLS/SSL\n  protocol when using compression. This side channel attack, dubbed\n  \u003cq\u003eCRIME\u003c/q\u003e, allows eavesdroppers to gather information to recover the\n  original plaintext in the protocol. This update disables compression.\nDSA-3253\nPound, a HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer, had several issues\nrelated to vulnerabilities in the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.\nFor Debian 7 (wheezy) this update adds a missing part to make it actually\npossible to disable client-initiated renegotiation and disables it by default\n(\u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3555\"\u003eCVE-2009-3555\u003c/a\u003e).\nTLS compression is disabled (\u003ca\nhref=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4929\"\u003eCVE-2012-4929\u003c/a\u003e),\nalthough this is normally already disabled by the OpenSSL system library.\nFinally it adds the ability to disable the SSLv3 protocol (\u003ca\nhref=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3566\"\u003eCVE-2014-3566\u003c/a\u003e)\nentirely via the new \u003cq\u003eDisableSSLv3\u003c/q\u003e configuration directive, although it\nwill not disabled by default in this update. Additionally a non-security\nsensitive issue in redirect encoding is\naddressed.\nFor Debian 8 (jessie) these issues have been fixed prior to the release,\nwith the exception of client-initiated renegotiation (\u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3555\"\u003eCVE-2009-3555\u003c/a\u003e).\nThis update addresses that issue for jessie.\n",
