      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2399\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in PHP, the web scripting\nlanguage. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies\nthe following issues:\nThe UNIX socket handling allowed attackers to trigger a buffer overflow\n  via a long path name.\nThe crypt_blowfish function did not properly handle 8-bit characters,\n  which made it easier for attackers to determine a cleartext password\n  by using knowledge of a password hash.\nWhen used on 32 bit platforms, the exif extension could be used to\n  trigger an integer overflow in the exif_process_IFD_TAG function\n  when processing a JPEG file.\nIt was possible to trigger hash collisions predictably when parsing\n  form parameters, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of\n  service by sending many crafted parameters.\nWhen applying a crafted XSLT transform, an attacker could write files\n  to arbitrary places in the filesystem.\nNOTE: the fix for \n\u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2483\"\u003eCVE-2011-2483\u003c/a\u003e \nrequired changing the behaviour of this function: it is now incompatible with \nsome old (wrongly) generated hashes for passwords containing 8-bit characters. \nSee the package NEWS entry for details. This change has not been applied to the \nLenny version of PHP.\n"
