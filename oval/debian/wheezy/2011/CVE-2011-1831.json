      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2382\nSeveral problems have been discovered in eCryptfs, a cryptographic\nfilesystem for Linux.\nVasiliy Kulikov of Openwall and Dan Rosenberg discovered that eCryptfs\n  incorrectly validated permissions on the requested mountpoint. A local\n  attacker could use this flaw to mount to arbitrary locations, leading\n  to privilege escalation.\nVasiliy Kulikov of Openwall and Dan Rosenberg discovered that eCryptfs\n  incorrectly validated permissions on the requested mountpoint. A local\n  attacker could use this flaw to unmount to arbitrary locations, leading\n  to a denial of service.\nDan Rosenberg and Marc Deslauriers discovered that eCryptfs incorrectly\n  handled modifications to the mtab file when an error occurs. A local\n  attacker could use this flaw to corrupt the mtab file, and possibly\n  unmount arbitrary locations, leading to a denial of service.\nMarc Deslauriers discovered that eCryptfs incorrectly handled keys when\n  setting up an encrypted private directory. A local attacker could use\n  this flaw to manipulate keys during creation of a new user.\nVasiliy Kulikov of Openwall discovered that eCryptfs incorrectly handled\n  lock counters. A local attacker could use this flaw to possibly overwrite\n  arbitrary files.\nWe acknowledge the work of the Ubuntu distribution in preparing patches\nsuitable for near-direct inclusion in the Debian package.\n",
