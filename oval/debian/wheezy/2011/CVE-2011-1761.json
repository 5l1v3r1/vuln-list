      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2415\nSeveral vulnerabilities that can lead to the execution of arbitrary code\nhave been discovered in libmodplug, a library for MOD music based on\nModPlug.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies\nthe following issues:\nepiphant discovered that the abc file parser is vulnerable to several\n    stack-based buffer overflows that potentially lead to the execution\n    of arbitrary code.\nHossein Lotfi of Secunia discovered that the CSoundFile::ReadWav\n    function is vulnerable to an integer overflow which leads to a\n    heap-based buffer overflow.  An attacker can exploit this flaw to\n    potentially execute arbitrary code by tricking a victim into opening\n    crafted WAV files.\nHossein Lotfi of Secunia discovered that the CSoundFile::ReadS3M\n    function is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow.  An attacker\n    can exploit this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary code by\n    tricking a victim into opening crafted S3M files.\nHossein Lotfi of Secunia discovered that the CSoundFile::ReadAMS\n    function suffers from an off-by-one vulnerability that leads to\n    memory corruption.  An attacker can exploit this flaw to potentially\n    execute arbitrary code by tricking a victim into opening crafted AMS\n    files.\nIt was discovered that the CSoundFile::ReadDSM function suffers\n    from an off-by-one vulnerability that leads to memory corruption.\n    An attacker can exploit this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary\n    code by tricking a victim into opening crafted DSM files.\nIt was discovered that the CSoundFile::ReadAMS2 function suffers\n    from an off-by-one vulnerability that leads to memory corruption.\n    An attacker can exploit this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary\n    code by tricking a victim into opening crafted AMS files.\n"
