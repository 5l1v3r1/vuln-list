      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3008\nSeveral vulnerabilities were found in PHP, a general-purpose scripting\nlanguage commonly used for web application development. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:\nIt was discovered that the original fix for \u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-7345\"\u003eCVE-2013-7345\u003c/a\u003e did not\n    sufficiently address the problem. A remote attacker could still\n    cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a specially-crafted\n    input file that triggers backtracking during processing of an awk\n    regular expression rule.\nIt was discovered that the CDF parser of the fileinfo module does\n    not properly process malformed files in the Composite Document File\n    (CDF) format, leading to crashes.\nIt was discovered that the original fix for \u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-4049\"\u003eCVE-2014-4049\u003c/a\u003e did not\n    completely address the issue. A malicious server or\n    man-in-the-middle attacker could cause a denial of service (crash)\n    and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted DNS TXT record.\nIt was discovered that PHP incorrectly handled certain SPL\n    Iterators. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause PHP to\n    crash, resulting in a denial of service.\n"
