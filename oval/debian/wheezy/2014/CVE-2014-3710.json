When checking ELF files, note headers are incorrectly\nchecked, thus potentially allowing attackers to cause a denial of\nservice (out-of-bounds read and application crash) by supplying a\nspecially crafted ELF file.\nAs announced in DSA-3064-1 it has been decided to follow the stable\n5.4.x releases for the Wheezy php5 packages. Consequently the\nvulnerability is addressed by upgrading PHP to a new upstream version\n5.4.35, which includes additional bug fixes, new features and possibly\nincompatible changes.
