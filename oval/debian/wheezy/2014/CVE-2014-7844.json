      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3104\nIt was discovered that bsd-mailx, an implementation of the \u003cq\u003email\u003c/q\u003e \ncommand, had an undocumented feature which treats syntactically valid \nemail addresses as shell commands to execute.\nUsers who need this feature can re-enable it using the \u003cq\u003eexpandaddr\u003c/q\u003e in \nan appropriate mailrc file.  This update also removes the obsolete \n\u003ccode\u003e-T\u003c/code\u003e option.  An older security vulnerability, \n\u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2004-2771\"\u003e\\\nCVE-2004-2771\u003c/a\u003e, had already been addressed in the Debian's bsd-mailx \npackage.\nNote that this security update does not remove all mailx facilities \nfor command execution, though.  Scripts which send mail to addresses \nobtained from an untrusted source (such as a web form) should use the \n\u003ccode\u003e--\u003c/code\u003e separator before the email addresses (which was fixed to work \nproperly in this update), or they should be changed to invoke \n\u003ccode\u003email -t\u003c/code\u003e or \u003ccode\u003esendmail -i -t\u003c/code\u003e instead, passing the \nrecipient addresses as part of the mail header.\n"
