      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3117\nSeveral vulnerabilities were found in PHP, a general-purpose scripting\nlanguage commonly used for web application development.\nAs announced in DSA 3064-1 it has been decided to follow the stable\n5.4.x releases for the Wheezy php5 packages. Consequently the\nvulnerabilities are addressed by upgrading PHP to a new upstream version\n5.4.36, which includes additional bug fixes, new features and possibly\nincompatible changes. Please refer to the upstream changelog for more\ninformation:\n\u003curl \"http://php.net/ChangeLog-5.php#5.4.36\"\u003e\nTwo additional patches were applied on top of the imported new upstream\nversion. An out-of-bounds read flaw was fixed which could lead php5-cgi\nto crash. Moreover a bug with php5-pgsql in combination with PostgreSQL\n9.1 was fixed \n(\u003ca href=\"https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=773182\"\u003e\\\nDebian Bug #773182\u003c/a\u003e).\n"
