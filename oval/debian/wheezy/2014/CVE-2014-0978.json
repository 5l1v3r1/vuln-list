      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2843\nTwo buffer overflow vulnerabilities were reported in Graphviz, a rich\ncollection of graph drawing tools. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project identifies the following issues:\nIt was discovered that user-supplied input used in the yyerror()\n    function in lib/cgraph/scan.l is not bound-checked before beeing\n    copied into an insufficiently sized memory buffer. A\n    context-dependent attacker could supply a specially crafted input\n    file containing a long line to cause a stack-based buffer overlow,\n    resulting in a denial of service (application crash) or potentially\n    allowing the execution of arbitrary code.\nSebastian Krahmer reported an overflow condition in the chkNum()\n    function in lib/cgraph/scan.l that is triggered as the used regular\n    expression accepts an arbitrary long digit list. With a specially\n    crafted input file, a context-dependent attacker can cause a\n    stack-based buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service\n    (application crash) or potentially allowing the execution of\n    arbitrary code.\n",
