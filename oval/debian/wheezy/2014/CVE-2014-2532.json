      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2894\nTwo vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenSSH, an implementation of the\nSSH protocol suite. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\nJann Horn discovered that OpenSSH incorrectly handled wildcards in\n    AcceptEnv lines. A remote attacker could use this issue to trick\n    OpenSSH into accepting any environment variable that contains the\n    characters before the wildcard character.\nMatthew Vernon reported that if a SSH server offers a\n    HostCertificate that the ssh client doesn't accept, then the client\n    doesn't check the DNS for SSHFP records. As a consequence a\n    malicious server can disable SSHFP-checking by presenting a\n    certificate.\nNote that a host verification prompt is still displayed before\n    connecting.\n"
