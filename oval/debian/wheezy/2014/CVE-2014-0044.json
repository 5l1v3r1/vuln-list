      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2854\nSeveral issues have been discovered in mumble, a low latency VoIP\nclient. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing issues:\nIt was discovered that a malformed Opus voice packet sent to a\n    Mumble client could trigger a NULL pointer dereference or an\n    out-of-bounds array access. A malicious remote attacker could\n    exploit this flaw to mount a denial of service attack against a\n    mumble client by causing the application to crash.\nIt was discovered that a malformed Opus voice packet sent to a\n    Mumble client could trigger a heap-based buffer overflow. A\n    malicious remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a client\n    crash (denial of service) or potentially use it to execute\n    arbitrary code.\nThe oldstable distribution (squeeze) is not affected by these problems.\n"
