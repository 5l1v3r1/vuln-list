The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies\nthe following problems:\nWebKit does not properly handle dynamic modification of a text node, which \n  allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service \n  (memory corruption and application crash) via a crafted HTML \n  document.\nThe rendering implementation in WebKit allows remote attackers to cause a \n  denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other \n  impact via unknown vectors.\nWebKit does not properly perform a cast of an unspecified variable during \n  processing of an SVG \u0026lt;use\u0026gt; element, which allows remote attackers to cause a \n  denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted SVG \n  document.\nWebKit does not properly handle animated GIF images, which allows remote \n  attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have \n  unspecified other impact via a crafted image.\nUse-after-free vulnerability in WebKit allows remote attackers to cause a \n  denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors \n  involving SVG animations.\nUse-after-free vulnerability in WebKit allows remote attackers to cause a\n  denial of service via vectors related to the handling of mouse dragging \n  events.\nThe CSSParser::parseFontFaceSrc function in WebCore/css/CSSParser.cpp in\n  WebKit does not properly parse Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) token sequences,\n  which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds \n  read) via a crafted local font, related to \u003cq\u003eType Confusion\u003c/q\u003e.\nWebKit does not properly perform cursor handling, which allows remote\n  attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other\n  impact via unknown vectors that lead to \u003cq\u003estale pointers\u003c/q\u003e.\nWebKit does not properly perform a cast of an unspecified variable during\n  handling of anchors, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of \n  service or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted HTML \n  document.\nWebKit does not properly restrict drag and drop operations, which might \n  allow remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy via unspecified \n  vectors.\n"
