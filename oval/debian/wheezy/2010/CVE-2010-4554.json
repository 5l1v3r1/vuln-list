The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following vulnerabilities:\nSquirrelMail did not prevent page rendering inside a third-party\n  HTML frame, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct\n  clickjacking attacks via a crafted web site.\nMultiple small bugs in SquirrelMail allowed an attacker to inject\n  malicious script into various pages or alter the contents of user\n  preferences.\nIt was possible to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a\n  crafted STYLE element in an HTML part of an e-mail message.\n",
