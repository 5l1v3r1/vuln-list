      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2818\nSeveral issues have been discovered in the MySQL database server. The\nvulnerabilities are addressed by upgrading MySQL to a new upstream\nversion, 5.5.33, which includes additional changes, such as performance\nimprovements, bug fixes, new features, and possibly incompatible\nchanges. Please see the MySQL 5.5 Release Notes for further details:\nIn addition this update fixes two issues affecting specifically the\nmysql-5.5 Debian package:\nA race condition in the post-installation script of the mysql-server-5.5\npackage creates the configuration file \u003cq\u003e/etc/mysql/debian.cnf\u003c/q\u003e with\nworld-readable permissions before restricting the permissions, which\nallows local users to read the file and obtain sensitive information\nsuch as credentials for the debian-sys-maint to perform\nadministration tasks. \n(\u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2162\"\u003e\\\nCVE-2013-2162\u003c/a\u003e)\nMatthias Reichl reported that the mysql-5.5 package misses the patches\napplied previous in Debian's mysql-5.1 to drop the database \u003cq\u003etest\u003c/q\u003e and\nthe permissions that allow anonymous access, without a password, from\nlocalhost to the \u003cq\u003etest\u003c/q\u003e database and any databases starting with\n\u003cq\u003etest_\u003c/q\u003e. This update reintroduces these patches for the mysql-5.5\npackage.\nExisting databases and permissions are not touched. Please refer to the\nNEWS file provided with this update for further information.\n"
