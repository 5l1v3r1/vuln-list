      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2770\nJohn Fitzpatrick of MWR InfoSecurity discovered an authentication bypass\nvulnerability in torque, a PBS-derived batch processing queueing system.\nThe torque authentication model revolves around the use of privileged\nports. If a request is not made from a privileged port then it is\nassumed not to be trusted or authenticated. It was found that pbs_mom\ndoes not perform a check to ensure that connections are established\nfrom a privileged port.\nA user who can run jobs or login to a node running pbs_server or pbs_mom\ncan exploit this vulnerability to remotely execute code as root on the\ncluster by submitting a command directly to a pbs_mom daemon\nto queue and run a job.\n",
