The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following issues:\nDavid Benjamin of Google reported that OpenSSL does not properly\n    handle SSL_read() and SSL_write() while being invoked in an error\n    state, causing data to be passed without being decrypted or\n    encrypted directly from the SSL/TLS record layer.\nIt was discovered that OpenSSL contains an overflow bug in the AVX2\n    Montgomery multiplication procedure used in exponentiation with\n    1024-bit moduli.\nDetails can be found in the upstream advisory:\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20171207.txt\"\u003ehttps://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20171207.txt\u003c/a\u003e\n"
