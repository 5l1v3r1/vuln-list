The vulnerability is due to an incorrect implementation of authentication in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted authentication request to the web-based management interface on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view limited configuration details and potentially upload a virtual machine image."
