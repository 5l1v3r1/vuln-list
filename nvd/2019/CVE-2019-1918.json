The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of IS\u0026ndash;IS link-state protocol data units (PDUs). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific link-state PDUs to an affected system to be processed. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause incorrect calculations used in the weighted remote shared risk link groups (SRLG) or in the IGP Flexible Algorithm. It could also cause tracebacks to the logs or potentially cause the receiving device to crash the IS\u0026ndash;IS process, resulting in a DoS condition."
