The integrated configuration web server of the affected devices could allow Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if unsuspecting users are tricked into accessing a malicious link. User interaction is required for a successful exploitation. The user must be logged into the web interface in order for the exploitation to succeed. At the stage of publishing this security advisory no public exploitation is known. The vendor has confirmed the vulnerability and provides mitigations to resolve it."
