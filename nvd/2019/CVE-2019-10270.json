It is possible (due to lack of verification and correlation between the reset password key sent by mail and the user_id parameter) to reset the password of another user. One only needs to know the user_id, which is publicly available. One just has to intercept the password modification request and modify user_id. It is possible to modify the passwords for any users or admin WordPress Ultimate Members. This could lead to account compromise and privilege escalation."
