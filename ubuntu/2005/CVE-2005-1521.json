  "Description": "Integer overflow in the fetch_io function of the imap4d server in GNU Mailutils 0.5 and 0.6, and other versions before 0.6.90, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a partial message request with a large value in the END parameter, which leads to a heap-based buffer overflow.",
