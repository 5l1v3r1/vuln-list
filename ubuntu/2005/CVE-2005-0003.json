  "Description": "The 64 bit ELF support in Linux kernel 2.6 before 2.6.10, on 64-bit architectures, does not properly check for overlapping VMA (virtual memory address) allocations, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code via a crafted ELF or a.out file.",
