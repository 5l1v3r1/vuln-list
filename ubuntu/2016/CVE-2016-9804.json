  "Description": "In BlueZ 5.42, a buffer overflow was observed in \"commands_dump\" function in \"tools/parser/csr.c\" source file. The issue exists because \"commands\" array is overflowed by supplied parameter due to lack of boundary checks on size of the buffer from frame \"frm-\u003eptr\" parameter. This issue can be triggered by processing a corrupted dump file and will result in hcidump crash.",
