  "Description": "Kornel Lesinski reported a significant security problem with Mantis' handling of attachments and MIME types. A user could upload a HTML file renamed to .gif and MantisBT would use Fileinfo to calculate the actual MIME type to be text/html. This is a problem because a user could be directed to click on a link purporting to be a .gif attachment when in fact it is a HTML document. Browsers would attempt to render the text/html attachment within the browser instead of treating it as a file download (or even just plaintext).",
