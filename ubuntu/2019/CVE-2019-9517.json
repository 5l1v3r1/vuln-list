  "Description": "This opens the HTTP/2 window so the server can send without constraint; however, it leaves the TCP window closed so the server cannot actually write (many of) the bytes on the wire. The client could then send a stream of requests for a large response object. Depending on how the servers queue the responses, this can consume excess memory, CPU, or both, potentially leading to a Denial-of-Service.  Also known as \"HTTP2 Internal Data Buffering / Queue Filler\".",
