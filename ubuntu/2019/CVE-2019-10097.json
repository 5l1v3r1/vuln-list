  "Description": "Apache: mod_remoteip stack buffer overflow and NULL pointer dereference. When mod_remoteip was configured to use a trusted intermediary proxy server using the \"PROXY\" protocol, a specially crafted PROXY header could trigger a stack buffer overflow or NULL pointer deference.  This vulnerability could only be triggered by a trusted proxy and not by untrusted HTTP clients. . PROXY protocol support was added to mod_remoteip in release 2.4.33.",
