  "Description": "hostapd (and wpa_supplicant when controlling AP mode) did not perform sufficient source address validation for some received Management frames and this could result in ending up sending a frame that caused associated stations to incorrectly believe they were disconnected from the network even if management frame protection (also known as PMF) was negotiated for the association. This could be considered to be a denial of service vulnerability since PMF is supposed to protect from this type of issues. It should be noted that if PMF is not enabled, there would be no protocol level protection against this type of denial service attacks.",
