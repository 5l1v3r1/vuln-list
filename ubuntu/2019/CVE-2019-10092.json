  "Description": "Apache: Limited cross-site scripting in mod_proxy. A limited cross-site scripting issue was reported affecting the mod_proxy error page. An attacker could cause the link on the error page to be malfomed and instead point to a page of their choice. This would only be exploitable where a server was set up with proxying enabled but was misconfigured in such a way that the Proxy Error page was displayed.",
