  "Description": "This sends a stream of frames with an empty payload and without the end-of-stream flag. Those frames can be DATA, HEADERS, CONTINUATION and/or PUSH_PROMISE. The server spends time processing each frame disproportionate to attack bandwidth. This can consume excess CPU, potentially leading to a Denial-of-Service. Also known as \"HTTP/2 Empty Frame Flooding\".",
