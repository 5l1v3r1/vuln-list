  "Description": "Heap corruption in scrypt_enc(); heap corruption was possible if the scrypt parameters (N, r, and p) were configurable by an attacker - for example, by providing the output of scrypt_enc() in a context where Hack/PHP code would attempt to verify it by re-running scrypt_enc() with the same parameters. This has been resolved by changing scrypt_enc() to use libsodiumâ€™s implementation, and scrypt_enc() now requires that HHVM was built with libsodium support. In 4.9, we consider scrypt_enc() deprecated, and it will be removed in a future release.",
