  "Description": "Apport contains an information disclosure vulnerability since it reads /proc/$PID/ files with elevated privileges during crash dump generation. This could allow a local attacker who could cause a PID race reuse during Apport crash dump generation to generate a crash report for a privileged process that is readable by an unprivileged user.",
