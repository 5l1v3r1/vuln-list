  "Description": "[ibus uses a GDBusServer with G_DBUS_SERVER_FLAGS_AUTHENTICATION_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS, and doesn't set a GDBusAuthObserver, which allows anyone who can connect to its AF_UNIX socket to authenticate and be authorized to send method calls.]",
  "UbuntuDescription": "Simon McVittie discovered that ibus did not enforce appropriate access controls on its private D-Bus socket. A local unprivileged user who discovers the ibus socket address of another user could exploit this to capture the key strokes of the other user.",
  "Notes": [
    "amurray\u003e The ibus D-Bus socket address contains a long random guid making discovery of this address by another user unlikely."
