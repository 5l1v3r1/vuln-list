  ],
  "Description": "It was found that the .buildfont1 procedure did not properly secure its privileged calls, enabling scripts to bypass `-dSAFER` restrictions. A specially crafted PostScript file could use this flaw to escalate its privileges and, for example, access files outside of restricted areas.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "Netanel Fisher discovered that the font handler in Ghostscript did not properly restrict privileged calls when '-dSAFER' restrictions were in effect. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted file, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue to access arbitrary files.",
