  "Description": "The Debian python-rdflib-tools 4.2.2-1 package for RDFLib 4.2.2 has CLI tools that can load Python modules from the current working directory, allowing code injection, because \"python -m\" looks in this directory, as demonstrated by rdf2dot. This issue is specific to use of the debian/scripts directory.",
