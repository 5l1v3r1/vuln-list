  "Description": "MicroK8s prior to v1.15.3 included a privilege escalation vulnerability, allowing a low privilege user to obtain root access to the host. MicroK8s allowed any user with access to the host to administer the underlying Kubernetes installation, including deploy pods. This allowed an attacker with local access to provision a privileged container and gain root access to the underlying host.",
