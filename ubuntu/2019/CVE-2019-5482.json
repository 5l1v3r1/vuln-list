  "Description": "[libcurl \u003e= 7.19.4 to and including 7.65.3 contains a heap buffer overflow in the function tftp_receive_packet() that receives data from a TFTP server. It can call recvfrom() with the default size for the buffer rather than with the size that was used to allocate it. Thus, the content that might overwrite the heap memory is controlled by the server.]",
