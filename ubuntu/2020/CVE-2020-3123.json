The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds read affecting users that have enabled the optional DLP feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted email file to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process crash, resulting in a denial of service condition.",
