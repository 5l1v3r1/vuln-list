  ],
  "Description": "A flaw was found in the way the Ceph RGW Beast front-end handles unexpected disconnect. An authenticated attacker can abuse this flaw by making multiple attempts of disconnect resulting in permanent leak of a socket connection by radosgw.  This flaw could lead to a denial of service condition by pile up of CLOSE_WAIT sockets, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources and preventing legitimate users from connecting to the system.",
