  "Description": "On some processors, under certain microarchitectural conditions involving a vector operation executing after a period of time where no vector operations executed, partial data values previously read from a vector register on a physical core may be propagated into unused portions of the store buffer. On processors affected by Microarchitectural Data Samping (MDS) or Transactional Asynchronous Abort (TAA), data from a store buffer entry may be inferred using one of these data sampling side channel methods. Using the MDS or TAA methods, itmay be possible for malicious actors to infer data values from previously read vector registers.  The vector register sampling method is not believed to affect processors that are not affected by MDS or TAA.",
