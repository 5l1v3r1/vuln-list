  "Description": "In PyYAML before 4.1, the yaml.load() API could execute arbitrary code. In other words, yaml.safe_load is not used.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "sarnold\u003e The patch changes the incredibly-unsafe yaml.load to the behaviour of safe_load; despite being many years overdue, it's also likely to break something.",
    "mdeslaur\u003e upstream has reverted the 4.1 fix, so as of 2019-02-13, there",
    "mdeslaur\u003e is no proper fix for this issue"
