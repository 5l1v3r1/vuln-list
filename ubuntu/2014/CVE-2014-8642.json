  "Description": "Mozilla Firefox before 35.0 and SeaMonkey before 2.32 do not consider the id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck extension in deciding whether to trust an OCSP responder, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by sniffing the network during a session in which there was an incorrect decision to accept a compromised and revoked certificate.",
