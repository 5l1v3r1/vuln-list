  "Description": "The atalk_sum_skb function in AppleTalk for Linux kernel 2.6.x before 2.6.21, and possibly 2.4.x, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via an AppleTalk frame that is shorter than the specified length, which triggers a BUG_ON call when an attempt is made to perform a checksum.",
