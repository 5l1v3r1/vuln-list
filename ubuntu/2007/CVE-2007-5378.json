  "Description": "Buffer overflow in the FileReadGIF function in tkImgGIF.c for Tk Toolkit 8.4.12 and earlier, and 8.3.5 and earlier, allows user-assisted attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) via an animated GIF in which the first subimage is smaller than a subsequent subimage, which triggers the overflow in the ReadImage function, a different vulnerability than CVE-2007-5137.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "USN-529-1 It was discovered that Tk could be made to overrun a buffer when loading certain images. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted GIF image, remote attackers could cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code with user privileges.",
