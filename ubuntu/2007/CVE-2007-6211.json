  "Description": "Send ICMP Nasty Garbage (sing) on Debian GNU/Linux allows local users to append to arbitrary files and gain privileges via the -L (output log file) option.  NOTE: this issue is only a vulnerability in limited environments, since sing is not installed setuid, and the administrator would need to override a non-setuid default during installation.",
