  "Description": "ext/filter in PHP 5.2.0, when FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING is used with the FILTER_FLAG_STRIP_LOW flag, does not properly strip HTML tags, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via HTML with a '\u003c' character followed by certain whitespace characters, which passes one filter but is collapsed into a valid tag, as demonstrated using %0b.",
