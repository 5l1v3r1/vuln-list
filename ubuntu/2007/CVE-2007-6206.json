  "Description": "The do_coredump function in fs/exec.c in Linux kernel 2.4.x and 2.6.x up to 2.6.24-rc3, and possibly other versions, does not change the UID of a core dump file if it exists before a root process creates a core dump in the same location, which might allow local users to obtain sensitive information.",
