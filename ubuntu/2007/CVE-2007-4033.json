  ],
  "Description": "Buffer overflow in the intT1_EnvGetCompletePath function in lib/t1lib/t1env.c in t1lib 5.1.1 allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long FileName parameter.  NOTE: this issue was originally reported to be in the imagepsloadfont function in php_gd2.dll in the gd (PHP_GD2) extension in PHP 5.2.3.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "It was discovered that t1lib does not properly perform bounds checking which can result in a buffer overflow vulnerability. An attacker could send specially crafted input to applications linked against t1lib which could result in a DoS or arbitrary code execution.",
  "Notes": [
    "jdstrand\u003e while tetex-bin and texlive-bin have embedded t1lib code, it's not used"
