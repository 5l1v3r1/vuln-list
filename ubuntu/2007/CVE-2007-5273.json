  "Description": "Sun Java Runtime Environment (JRE) in JDK and JRE 6 Update 2 and earlier, JDK and JRE 5.0 Update 12 and earlier, SDK and JRE 1.4.2_15 and earlier, and SDK and JRE 1.3.1_20 and earlier, when an HTTP proxy server is used, allows remote attackers to violate the security model for an applet's outbound connections via a multi-pin DNS rebinding attack in which the applet download relies on DNS resolution on the proxy server, but the applet's socket operations rely on DNS resolution on the local machine, a different issue than CVE-2007-5274. NOTE: this is similar to CVE-2007-5232.",
