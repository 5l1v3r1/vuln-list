  "Description": "Multiple race conditions in Smb4K before 0.8.0 allow local users to (1) modify arbitrary files via unspecified manipulations of Smb4K's lock file, which is not properly handled by the remove_lock_file function in core/smb4kfileio.cpp, and (2) add lines to the sudoers file via a symlink attack on temporary files, which isn't properly handled by the writeFile function in core/smb4kfileio.cpp.",
