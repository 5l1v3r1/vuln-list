  "Description": "Interpretation conflict between Microsoft Internet Explorer and DocuWiki before 2007-06-26b allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript and conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks when spellchecking UTF-8 encoded messages via the spell_utf8test function in lib/exe/spellcheck.php, which triggers HTML document identification and script execution by Internet Explorer even though the Content-Type header is text/plain.",
