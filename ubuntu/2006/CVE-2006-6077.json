  "Description": "The (1) Password Manager in Mozilla Firefox 2.0, and 1.5.0.8 and earlier; and the (2) Passcard Manager in Netscape 8.1.2 and possibly other versions, do not properly verify that an ACTION URL in a FORM element containing a password INPUT element matches the web site for which the user stored a password, which allows remote attackers to obtain passwords via a password INPUT element on a different web page located on the web site intended for this password.",
