  "Description": "Linux kernel does not properly save or restore EFLAGS during a context switch, or reset the flags when creating new threads, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (process crash), as demonstrated using a process that sets the Alignment Check flag (EFLAGS 0x40000), which triggers a SIGBUS in other processes that have an unaligned access.",
