  "Description": "The sPLT chunk handling code (png_set_sPLT function in pngset.c) in libpng 1.0.6 through 1.2.12 uses a sizeof operator on the wrong data type, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via malformed sPLT chunks that trigger an out-of-bounds read.",
