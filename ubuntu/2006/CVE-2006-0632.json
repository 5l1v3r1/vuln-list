  "Description": "The gen_rand_string function in phpBB 2.0.19 uses insufficiently random data (small value space) to create the activation key (\"validation ID\") that is sent by e-mail when establishing a password, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain the key and modify passwords for existing accounts or create new accounts.",
