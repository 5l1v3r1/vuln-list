  "Description": "PHP before 5.1.3-RC1 might allow remote attackers to obtain portions of memory via crafted binary data sent to a script that processes user input in the html_entity_decode function and sends the encoded results back to the client, aka a \"binary safety\" issue.  NOTE: this issue has been referred to as a \"memory leak,\" but it is an information leak that discloses memory contents.",
