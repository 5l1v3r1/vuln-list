  "Description": "** DISPUTED ** Virtualenv 16.0.0 allows a sandbox escape via \"python $(bash \u003e\u00262)\" and \"python $(rbash \u003e\u00262)\" commands. NOTE: the software maintainer disputes this because the Python interpreter in a virtualenv is supposed to be able to execute arbitrary code.",
  "UbuntuDescription": "",
  "Notes": [
    "msalvatore\u003e Upstream has asked MITRE to reject this as not a security vulnerability. Upstream says, \"Python in the virtualenv \"sandbox\" is 0% secure; it's neither designed to nor does it provide any protection against malicious code. You seem very confused about the purpose of virtualenv.\" https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv/issues/1207#issuecomment-426616819"
