  "Description": "** DISPUTED ** An issue has been found in HTSlib 1.8. It is a memory leak in bgzf_getline in bgzf.c. NOTE: the software maintainer's position is that the \"failure to free memory\" can be fixed in applications that use the HTSlib library (such as test/test_bgzf.c in the original report) and is not a library issue.",
