  "Description": "Buffer overflow in the Gfx::doImage function in Gfx.cc for xpdf 3.00, and other products that share code such as tetex-bin and kpdf in KDE 3.2.x to 3.2.3 and 3.3.x to 3.3.2, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted PDF file that causes the boundaries of a maskColors array to be exceeded.",
