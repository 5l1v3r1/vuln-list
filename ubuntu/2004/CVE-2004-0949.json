  "Description": "The smb_recv_trans2 function call in the samba filesystem (smbfs) in Linux kernel 2.4 and 2.6 does not properly handle the re-assembly of fragmented packets correctly, which could allow remote samba servers to (1) read arbitrary kernel information or (2) raise a counter value to an arbitrary number by sending the first part of the fragmented packet multiple times.",
