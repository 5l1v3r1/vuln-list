  "description": "** DISPUTED ** In inspect.cpp in LibSass 3.5.5, a high memory footprint caused by an endless loop (containing a Sass::Inspect::operator()(Sass::String_Quoted*) stack frame) may cause a Denial of Service via crafted sass input files with stray '\u0026' or '/' characters. NOTE: Upstream comments indicate this issue is closed as \"won't fix\" and \"works as intended\" by design.",
