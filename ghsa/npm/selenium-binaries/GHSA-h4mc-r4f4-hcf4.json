    "Description": "selenium-binaries downloads Selenium related binaries for your OS. selenium-binaries downloads binary resources over HTTP, which leaves it vulnerable to MITM attacks. It may be possible to cause remote code execution (RCE) by swapping out the requested binary with an attacker controlled binary if the attacker is on the network or positioned in between the user and the remote server.\r\n\r\nNo fix is currently available for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThe best mitigation currently available is to use an alternate package, such as selenium-webdriver, the official selenium bindings for node.js.",
