    "Description": "Affected versions of sync-exec use files located in /tmp/ to buffer command results before returning values. As /tmp/ is almost always set with world readable permissions, this may allow low privilege users on the system to read the results of commands run via sync-exec under a higher privilege user.\r\n\r\nThere is currently no direct patch for sync-exec, as the child_process.execSync function provided in Node.js v0.12.0 and later provides the same functionality natively.\r\n\r\nThe best mitigation currently is to update to Node.js v0.12.0 or later, and migrate all uses of sync-exec to child_process.execSync().",
