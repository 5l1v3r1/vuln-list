    "Description": "## regular expressions Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability\n\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS). It does not properly mitigate against unsafe characters in serialized regular expressions.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is not affected on Node.js environment since Node.js's implementation of `RegExp.prototype.toString()` backslash-escapes all forward slashes in regular expressions.\r\n\r\nIf serialized data of regular expression objects are used in an environment other than Node.js, it is affected by this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\n\r\nThis was patched in v2.1.1.\r\n\n",
