    "Description": "There are high severity security vulnerabilities in two of ESLint's dependencies:\n    - [acorn](https://app.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-ACORN-559469)\n    - [minimist](https://app.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-MINIMIST-559764)\n  \nThe releases 1.8.3 and lower of svjsl (JSLib-npm) are vulnerable, but only if installed in a developer environment. A patch has been released (v1.8.4) which fixes these vulnerabilities.  \n  \n### Edit:  \nApparently not only dependent repositories of `svjsl` got this security advisory, but anyone who uses the packages `acorn` and `minimist`. To those people: You don't need to install my package, just make sure to follow the advisories [here](https://app.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-ACORN-559469) and [here](https://app.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-MINIMIST-559764).  \n  \n### Identifiers:\n- [CVE-2020-7598](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-7598)\n- SNYK-JS-ACORN-559469 (doesn't have a CVE identifier)",
