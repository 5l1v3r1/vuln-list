    "Description": "## Test breaking\n\n### Impact\r\nIn v1.2.0, tests are broken: all tests are always succeeding. If tests are looking for security vulnerabilities, these were compromised.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\nUsers should upgrade to `v1.2.1`\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\nUsers who don't use eye.js for looking for vulnerabilities are safe. Upgrading will just fix some bugs.\r\n\r\n### For more information\r\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\r\n* Open an issue in [EyeJS](https://github.com/arguiot/EyeJS)\r\n* Email us at [arguiot@gmail.com](mailto:arguiot@gmail.com)\r\n\n",
