This issue affects anyone requesting content from untrusted sources.\r\n\r\n### Patches\r\n\r\nVersion 2.4.0 resolves the issue by limiting the size of buffered response body.\r\n\r\n### Workarounds\r\n\r\nAttempting workarounds isn't recommended. Updating is preferred.\r\n\r\n### For more information\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, open an issue in [ethanent/centra](https://github.com/ethanent/centra).\r\n\n",
