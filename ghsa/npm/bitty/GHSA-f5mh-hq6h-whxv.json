    "Description": "Bitty is a development web server tool that functions similar to `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`. Version 0.2.10 has a directory traversal vulnerability that is exploitable via the URL path in GET requests.\r\n\r\nThe bitty package is not currently maintained, and has not seen an update since 2015.\r\n\r\nAt this time, the best available mitigation is to use an alternative module that is actively maintained and provides similar functionality, such as serve.",
