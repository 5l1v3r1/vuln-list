  "statement": "\nThe PHP interpreter does not offer a reliable \"sandboxed\" security layer (as found in, say, a JVM) in which untrusted scripts can be run any script run by the PHP interpreter must be trusted with the privileges of the interpreter itself.  This bug described in CVE-2007-2511 can only be triggered by a script author since no trust boundary is crossed, this issue is not treated as security-sensitive.\n    "
