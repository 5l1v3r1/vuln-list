    "\nSquid, when transparent interception mode is enabled, uses the HTTP Host header to determine the remote endpoint, which allows remote attackers to bypass access controls for Flash, Java, Silverlight, and probably other technologies, and possibly communicate with restricted intranet sites, via a crafted web page that causes a client to send HTTP requests with a modified Host header.\n    ",
    "\nIt was found that when transparent interception mode was enabled in squid a remote attacker could bypass access controls implemented for certain web elements like Flash and Java and communicate with restricted intranet sites via crafted Host headers.\n    "
