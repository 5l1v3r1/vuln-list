  "details": [
    "\nMozilla Necko, as used in Thunderbird 3.0.1, SeaMonkey, and other applications, performs DNS prefetching even when the app type is APP_TYPE_MAIL or APP_TYPE_EDITOR, which makes it easier for remote attackers to determine the network location of the application's user by logging DNS requests, as demonstrated by DNS requests triggered by reading text/plain e-mail messages in Thunderbird.\n    "
