    "\nIn the HDF5 1.8.16 library's failure to check if the number of dimensions for an array read from the file is within the bounds of the space allocated for it, a heap-based buffer overflow will occur, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.\n    ",
    "\nMultiple heap overflows were found in HDF5. These issues could be used to gain code execution in any program that exposes the affected functions to untrusted input. While HDF5 is shipped as a dependency, no Red Hat products are known to expose these issues in any supported use case at this time.\n    "
