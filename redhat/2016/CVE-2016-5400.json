    "\nMemory leak in the airspy_probe function in drivers/media/usb/airspy/airspy.c in the airspy USB driver in the Linux kernel before 4.7 allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a crafted USB device that emulates many VFL_TYPE_SDR or VFL_TYPE_SUBDEV devices and performs many connect and disconnect operations.\n    ",
    "\nA flaw was found in the linux kernel's implementation of the airspy USB device driver in which a leak was found when a subdev or SDR are plugged into the host.\n\nAn attacker can create an targeted USB device which can emulate 64 of these devices. Then by emulating an additional device which continuously connects and\ndisconnects, each connection attempt will leak memory which can not be recovered.\n    "
