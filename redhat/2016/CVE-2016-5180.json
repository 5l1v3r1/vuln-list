    "\nHeap-based buffer overflow in the ares_create_query function in c-ares 1.x before 1.12.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a hostname with an escaped trailing dot.\n    ",
    "\nA vulnerability was found in c-ares. A hostname with an escaped trailing dot (such as \"hello\\.\") would have its size calculated incorrectly, leading to a single byte written beyond the end of a buffer on the heap. An attacker able to provide such a hostname to an application using c-ares, could potentially cause that application to crash.\n    "
