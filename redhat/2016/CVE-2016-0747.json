    "\nThe resolver in nginx before 1.8.1 and 1.9.x before 1.9.10 does not properly limit CNAME resolution, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (worker process resource consumption) via vectors related to arbitrary name resolution.\n    ",
    "\nIt was discovered that nginx did not limit recursion when resolving CNAME DNS records. An attacker able to manipulate DNS responses received by nginx could use this flaw to cause a worker process to use an excessive amount of resources if nginx enabled the resolver in its configuration.\n    "
