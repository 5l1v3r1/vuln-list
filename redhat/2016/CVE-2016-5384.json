  "details": [
    "\nfontconfig before 2.12.1 does not validate offsets, which allows local users to trigger arbitrary free calls and consequently conduct double free attacks and execute arbitrary code via a crafted cache file.\n    ",
    "\nIt was found that cache files were insufficiently validated in fontconfig. A local attacker could create a specially crafted cache file to trigger arbitrary free() calls, which in turn could lead to arbitrary code execution.\n    "
