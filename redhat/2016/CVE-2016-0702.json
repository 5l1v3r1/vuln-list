    "\nA side-channel attack was found that makes use of cache-bank conflicts on the Intel Sandy-Bridge microarchitecture. An attacker who has the ability to control code in a thread running on the same hyper-threaded core as the victim's thread that is performing decryption, could use this flaw to recover RSA private keys.\n    "
