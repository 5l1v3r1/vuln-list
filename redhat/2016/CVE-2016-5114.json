    "\nAn out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the fpm_log_write() logging function of PHP's FastCGI Process Manager service. A remote attacker could repeatedly send maliciously crafted requests to force FPM to exhaust file system space, creating a denial of service and preventing further logging.\n    "
