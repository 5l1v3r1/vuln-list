    "\nIt was discovered that the zebra daemon in Quagga before 1.0.20161017 suffered from a stack-based buffer overflow when processing IPv6 Neighbor Discovery messages. The root cause was relying on BUFSIZ to be compatible with a message size; however, BUFSIZ is system-dependent.\n    ",
    "\nA stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Quagga handled IPv6 router advertisement messages. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the zebra daemon resulting in denial of service.\n    "
