  "details": [
    "\nThe resend_bytes function in roaming_common.c in the client in OpenSSH 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x before 7.1p2 allows remote servers to obtain sensitive information from process memory by requesting transmission of an entire buffer, as demonstrated by reading a private key.\n    ",
    "\nAn information leak flaw was found in the way the OpenSSH client roaming feature was implemented. A malicious server could potentially use this flaw to leak portions of memory (possibly including private SSH keys) of a successfully authenticated OpenSSH client.\n    "
  ],
  "mitigation": "\n1. The vulnerable roaming code can be permanently disabled by adding the\nundocumented option \"UseRoaming no\" to the system-wide configuration\nfile (usually /etc/ssh/ssh_config), or per-user configuration file\n(~/.ssh/config), or command-line (-o \"UseRoaming no\").\n\n2. If an OpenSSH client is disconnected from an SSH server that offers\nroaming, it prints \"[connection suspended, press return to resume]\" on\nstderr, and waits for '\\n' or '\\r' on stdin (and not on the controlling\nterminal) before it reconnects to the server; advanced users may become\nsuspicious and press Control-C or Control-Z instead, thus avoiding the\ninformation leak.\n\nHowever, SSH commands that use the local stdin to transfer data to the\nremote server are bound to trigger this reconnection automatically (upon\nreading a '\\n' or '\\r' from stdin). Moreover, these non-interactive SSH\ncommands (for example, backup scripts and cron jobs) commonly employ\npublic-key authentication and are therefore perfect targets for this\ninformation leak.\n    ",
