    "\nThe resolver in nginx before 1.8.1 and 1.9.x before 1.9.10 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid pointer dereference and worker process crash) via a crafted UDP DNS response.\n    ",
    "\nIt was discovered that nginx could perform an out of bound read and dereference an invalid pointer when resolving CNAME DNS records. An attacker able to manipulate DNS responses received by nginx could use this flaw to cause a worker process to crash if nginx enabled the resolver in its configuration.\n    "
