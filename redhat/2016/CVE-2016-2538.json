    "\nMultiple integer overflows in the USB Net device emulator (hw/usb/dev-network.c) in QEMU before 2.5.1 allow local guest OS administrators to cause a denial of service (QEMU process crash) or obtain sensitive host memory information via a remote NDIS control message packet that is mishandled in the (1) rndis_query_response, (2) rndis_set_response, or (3) usb_net_handle_dataout function.\n    ",
    "\nAn integer-overflow issue was found in the QEMU emulator built with USB Net device emulation support. The flaw could occur while processing remote NDIS control message packets because the incoming informationBufferOffset \u0026 Length combination could cross the integer range. A privileged user inside a guest could use this flaw to leak host memory bytes to the guest, or crash the QEMU process instance (denial of service).\n    "
