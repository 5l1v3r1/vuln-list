  "details": [
    "\nThe asn1_ber_decoder function in lib/asn1_decoder.c in the Linux kernel before 4.3 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (panic) via an ASN.1 BER file that lacks a public key, leading to mishandling by the public_key_verify_signature function in crypto/asymmetric_keys/public_key.c.\n    ",
    "\nA syntax vulnerability was discovered in the kernel's ASN1.1 DER decoder, which could lead to memory corruption or a complete local denial of service through x509 certificate DER files. A local system user could use a specially created key file to trigger BUG_ON() in the public_key_verify_signature() function (crypto/asymmetric_keys/public_key.c), to cause a kernel panic and crash the system.\n    "
