  "details": [
    "\nThe IPv4 implementation in the Linux kernel before 4.5.2 mishandles destruction of device objects, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host OS networking outage) by arranging for a large number of IP addresses.\n    ",
    "\nA security flaw was found in the Linux kernel's networking subsystem that destroying the network interface with huge number of ipv4 addresses assigned keeps \"rtnl_lock\" spinlock for a very long time (up to hour). This blocks many network-related operations, including creation of new incoming ssh connections.\n\nThe problem is especially important for containers, as the container owner has enough permissions to trigger this and block a network access on a whole host, outside the container.\n    "
