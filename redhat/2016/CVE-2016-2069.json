    "\nRace condition in arch/x86/mm/tlb.c in the Linux kernel before 4.4.1 allows local users to gain privileges by triggering access to a paging structure by a different CPU.\n    ",
    "\nA flaw was discovered in the way the Linux kernel dealt with paging structures. When the kernel invalidated a paging structure that was not in use locally, it could, in principle, race against another CPU that is switching to a process that uses the paging structure in question. A local user could use a thread running with a stale cached virtual-\u003ephysical translation to potentially escalate their privileges if the translation in question were writable and the physical page got reused for something critical (for example, a page table).\n    "
