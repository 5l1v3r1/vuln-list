    "\nQEMU (aka Quick Emulator) built with the TPR optimization for 32-bit Windows guests support is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference flaw. It occurs while doing I/O port write operations via hmp interface. In that, 'current_cpu' remains null, which leads to the null pointer dereference. A user or process could use this flaw to crash the QEMU instance, resulting in DoS issue.\n    ",
    "\nA NULL-pointer dereference flaw was found in the QEMU emulator built with TPR optimization for 32-bit Windows guests support. The flaw occurs when doing I/O-port write operations from the HMP interface. The 'current_cpu' value remains null because it is not called from the cpu_exec() loop, and dereferencing it results in the flaw. An attacker with access to the HMP interface could use this flaw to crash the QEMU instance (denial of service).\n    "
