    "\nThe (1) roaming_read and (2) roaming_write functions in roaming_common.c in the client in OpenSSH 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x before 7.1p2, when certain proxy and forward options are enabled, do not properly maintain connection file descriptors, which allows remote servers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact by requesting many forwardings.\n    ",
    "\nA buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the OpenSSH client roaming feature was implemented. A malicious server could potentially use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on a successfully authenticated OpenSSH client if that client used certain non-default configuration options.\n    "
