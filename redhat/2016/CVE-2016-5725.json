    "\nDirectory traversal vulnerability in JCraft JSch before 0.1.54 on Windows, when the mode is ChannelSftp.OVERWRITE, allows remote SFTP servers to write to arbitrary files via a ..\\ (dot dot backslash) in a response to a recursive GET command.\n    ",
    "\nA vulnerability was discovered in JSch that allows a malicious sftp server to force a client-side relative path traversal in jsch's implementation for recursive sftp-get. An attacker could leverage this to write files outside the client's download basedir with effective permissions of the jsch sftp client process.\n    "
