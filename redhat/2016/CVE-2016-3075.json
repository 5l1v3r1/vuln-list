  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "\nStack-based buffer overflow in the nss_dns implementation of the getnetbyname function in GNU C Library (aka glibc) before 2.24 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (stack consumption and application crash) via a long name.\n    ",
    "\nA stack overflow vulnerability was found in _nss_dns_getnetbyname_r. On systems with nsswitch configured to include \"networks: dns\" with a privileged or network-facing service that would attempt to resolve user-provided network names, an attacker could provide an excessively long network name, resulting in stack corruption and code execution.\n    "
