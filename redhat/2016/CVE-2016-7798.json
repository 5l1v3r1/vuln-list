  "details": [
    "\nThe openssl gem for Ruby uses the same initialization vector (IV) in GCM Mode (aes-*-gcm) when the IV is set before the key, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to bypass the encryption protection mechanism.\n    "
  ],
  "mitigation": "\nA possible workaround to this flaw is, when using aes-256-gcm mode, always set the key first and then the iv. For example when setting random keys and iv use the following code segment:\n\nkey = cipher.random_key\niv = cipher.random_iv\n    ",
