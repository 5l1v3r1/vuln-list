    "\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of XFS file attributes. Two memory leaks were detected in xfs_attr_shortform_list and xfs_attr3_leaf_list_int when running a docker container backed by xfs/overlay2.  A dedicated attacker could possible exhaust all memory and create a denial of service situation.\n    "
