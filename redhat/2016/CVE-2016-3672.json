    "\nThe arch_pick_mmap_layout function in arch/x86/mm/mmap.c in the Linux kernel through 4.5.2 does not properly randomize the legacy base address, which makes it easier for local users to defeat the intended restrictions on the ADDR_NO_RANDOMIZE flag, and bypass the ASLR protection mechanism for a setuid or setgid program, by disabling stack-consumption resource limits.\n    ",
    "\nA weakness was found in the Linux ASLR implementation. Any user able to running 32-bit applications in a x86 machine can disable ASLR by setting the RLIMIT_STACK resource to unlimited.\n    "
