  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "\nMultiple integer overflows in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1s and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2g allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption or NULL pointer dereference) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a long digit string that is mishandled by the (1) BN_dec2bn or (2) BN_hex2bn function, related to crypto/bn/bn.h and crypto/bn/bn_print.c.\n    ",
    "\nAn integer overflow flaw, leading to a NULL pointer dereference or a heap-based memory corruption, was found in the way some BIGNUM functions of OpenSSL were implemented. Applications that use these functions with large untrusted input could crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.\n    "
