    "\ndrivers/vfio/pci/vfio_pci.c in the Linux kernel through 4.8.11 allows local users to bypass integer overflow checks, and cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or have unspecified other impact, by leveraging access to a vfio PCI device file for a VFIO_DEVICE_SET_IRQS ioctl call, aka a \"state machine confusion bug.\"\n    ",
    "\nA flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's implementation of VFIO. An attacker issuing an ioctl can create a situation where memory is corrupted and modify memory outside of the expected area. This may overwrite kernel memory and subvert kernel execution.\n    "
