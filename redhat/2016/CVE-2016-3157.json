    "\nThe __switch_to function in arch/x86/kernel/process_64.c in the Linux kernel does not properly context-switch IOPL on 64-bit PV Xen guests, which allows local guest OS users to gain privileges, cause a denial of service (guest OS crash), or obtain sensitive information by leveraging I/O port access.\n    ",
