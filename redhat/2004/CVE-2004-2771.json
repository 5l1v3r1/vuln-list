    "\nA flaw was found in the way mailx handled the parsing of email addresses. A syntactically valid email address could allow a local attacker to cause mailx to execute arbitrary shell commands through shell meta-characters (CVE-2004-2771) and the direct command execution functionality (CVE-2014-7844).\n    "
