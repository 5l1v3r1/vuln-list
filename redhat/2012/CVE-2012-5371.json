    "\nRuby (aka CRuby) 1.9 before 1.9.3-p327 and 2.0 before r37575 computes hash values without properly restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted input to an application that maintains a hash table, as demonstrated by a universal multicollision attack against a variant of the MurmurHash2 algorithm, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-4815.\n    "
