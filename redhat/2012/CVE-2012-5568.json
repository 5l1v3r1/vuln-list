  "statement": "\nThis issue affects tomcat and jbossweb as shipped in various Red Hat products. This issue can be mitigated using appropriate firewall configuration, as noted here: \n\nhttps://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2007-6750\n\nThis issue can also be partially mitigated by configuring an appropriate timeout using the connectionTimeout property for the relevant Connector(s) defined in server.xml, but testing shows that some variants of the attack may still be effective with this configuration. The tomcat project has advised that although this flaw can affect tomcat, there is no good solution available, and the tomcat security team does not consider it a vulnerability in tomcat or plan to release a patch:\n \nhttp://tomcat.apache.org/security-7.html#Not_a_vulnerability_in_Tomcat\n    ",
