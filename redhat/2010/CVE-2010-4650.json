It did not affect the version of Linux\nkernel as shipped with Red hat Enterprise MRG as it did not provide support\nfor Character device in Userspace (CUSE). A future kernel update in Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 6 may address this flaw. Note that, by default, the\n\"/dev/cuse\" file in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is only accessible by the\nroot user.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 6: \nThis vulnerability has been rated as having a security impact of Moderate. After evaluation and in accordance with the criteria noted in the product support life cycle, there are no plans to address this issue in an upcoming release.
