By default, /var/spool/mail/ is not provided with permissions to make an attack scenario possible, and there is no reason for permissions to be relaxed in such a way as to make it possible.  We therefore have no plans to fix this flaw in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 or 5.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 4: \nThis vulnerability has been rated as having a security impact of Moderate. After evaluation and in accordance with the criteria noted in the product support life cycle, there are no plans to address this issue in an upcoming release.
