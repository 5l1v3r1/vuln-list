Debugfs is not mounted by default. You need to run \"mount -t debugfs nodev /sys/kernel/debug\" as root first.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise MRG 1 (realtime-kernel):\nThis vulnerability has been rated as having a security impact of Moderate. After evaluation and in accordance with the criteria noted in the product support life cycle, there are no plans to address this issue in an upcoming release.
