    "\nloaders/load_it.c in libmikmod, possibly 3.1.12, does not properly account for the larger size of name##env relative to name##tick and name##node, which allows remote attackers to trigger a buffer over-read and possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted Impulse Tracker file, a related issue to CVE-2010-2546.  NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2009-3995.\n    "
