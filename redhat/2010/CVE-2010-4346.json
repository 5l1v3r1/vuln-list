  "statement": "\nThe Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 is not vulnerable because it checks for mmap_min_addr even in special cases.\n\nThe Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG have mmap_min_addr sysctl tunable set to 4096, and therefore are not affected by this issue. However, as a preventive measure (for example, for administrators who have increased mmap_min_addr), we have addressed this in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and MRG via https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0429.html, https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0421.html, and https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0330.html.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise MRG 1 (realtime-kernel):\nThis vulnerability has been rated as having a security impact of Low. After evaluation and in accordance with the criteria noted in the product support life cycle, there are no plans to address this issue in an upcoming release.
