    "\nThe connection tracking core of Netfilter for Linux 2.4.20, with CONFIG_IP_NF_CONNTRACK enabled or the ip_conntrack module loaded, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption) due to an inconsistency with Linux 2.4.20's support of linked lists, which causes Netfilter to fail to identify connections with an UNCONFIRMED status and use large timeouts.\n    "
