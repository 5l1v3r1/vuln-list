  "statement": "\nGnome uses the ibus input framework only when the user explicitly configures it or when some input method sources are in use, like Korean from the ibus-hangul package or Chinese input methods from the ibus-libpinyin. Input methods like en-US are not handled by ibus, thus if the victim user just use them the attacker will not be able to intercept the key strokes of that user.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 6: \nThis vulnerability has been rated as having a security impact of Moderate.

    "\nA flaw was discovered in ibus that allows any unprivileged user to monitor and send method calls to the ibus bus of another user due to a misconfiguration in the DBus server setup. A local attacker may use this flaw to intercept all keystrokes of a victim user who is using the graphical interface, change the input method engine, or modify other input related configurations of the victim user.\n    "
