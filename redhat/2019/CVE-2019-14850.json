  "mitigation": "\nThis attack is only possible if nbdkit is configured with a plugin that does a lot of work in its initial .open() callback. Some examples that do a lot of work are nbdkit-ssh-plugin and nbdkit-guestfs-plugin. The nbdkit-memory-plugin is an example that does very little work, and thus is not subject to this vulnerability.\n\nOnly attackers that can connect to the nbdkit service can exploit this vulnerability. If nbdkit is not exposed over TCP (eg, nbdkit -U), or is bound only to a private network interface, or is protected by firewall rules, the attack surface is correspondingly limited.\n    ",
