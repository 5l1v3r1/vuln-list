    "\nA buffer overflow flaw was found, in versions from 2.6.34 to 5.2.x, in the way Linux kernel's vhost functionality that translates virtqueue buffers to IOVs, logged the buffer descriptors during migration. A privileged guest user able to pass descriptors with invalid length to the host when migration is underway, could use this flaw to increase their privileges on the host.\n    ",

  "mitigation": "\nOption #1 Disabling vhost-net\n\nVhost-net functionality can be disabled on per-guest basis. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/virtualization_deployment_and_administration_guide/sect-network_configuration-disabling_vhost_net.\n\nAlternatively, the kernel module named 'vhost_net' which contains the affected code can be blacklisted using the standard blacklisting techniques. See https://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278 for how to blacklist a kernel module.\n\nGuests utilizing vhost-net functionality need to be rebooted for the changes to take effect.\n\nOption #2 Disabling guest live migration\n\nThe issue is only exploitable from the guest when migration is underway, so avoiding migration by either disabling automatic migration completely or not migrating the guests manually is an effective way to avoid exploitation.\n    ",
