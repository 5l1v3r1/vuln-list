    "\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.0.4. There is a use-after-free upon attempted read access to /proc/ioports after the ipmi_si module is removed, related to drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_si_intf.c, drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_si_mem_io.c, and drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi_si_port_io.c.\n    ",
    "\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of IPMI (remote baseband access). An attacker, with local access to read /proc/ioports, may be able to create a use-after-free condition when the kernel module is unloaded which may result in privilege escalation.\n    "
  ],
  "mitigation": "\nA mitigation to this flaw would be to no longer use IPMI on affected hardware until the kernel has been updated. Existing systems that have IPMI kernel modules loaded will need to unload the \"ipmi_si\" kernel module and blacklist ( See https://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278 for a guide on how to blacklist modules). Take careful consideration that if unloading and blacklisting the module, this creates a one-time attack vector window for a local attacker.\n    ",
