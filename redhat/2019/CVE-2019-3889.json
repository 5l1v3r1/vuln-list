  "statement": "\nSince the HTTP Response \"Content Type\" is \"text/plain\" most browsers won't execute any Javascipt in the response content. However if an attacker can trick a user into loading the response in an iFrame it is possible to exploit this vulnerability. Appropriate Cross Origin Resource (CORS) Allowed Domain configuration in OCP 3 should prevent an attacker from getting any response from a attacker hosted domain. Therefore make sure that corsAllowedDomains is specified correctly in your OCP 3 master-config.yaml. See [1] for more details on an issue with corsAllowedDomains in OCP 3.\n\n[1] https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1694913\n\nAlso content sniffing browsers [2] do execute Javascript even when the \"Content Type\" HTTP Response header is set to \"text/plain\".\n\n[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_sniffing\n    ",
