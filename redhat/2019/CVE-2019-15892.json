    "\nAn issue was discovered in Varnish Cache before 6.0.4 LTS, and 6.1.x and 6.2.x before 6.2.1. An HTTP/1 parsing failure allows a remote attacker to trigger an assert by sending crafted HTTP/1 requests. The assert will cause an automatic restart with a clean cache, which makes it a Denial of Service attack.\n    ",
    "\nA flaw was found in the way Varnish parsed certain HTTP/1 requests. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash Varnish by sending specially crafted multiple HTTP/1 requests processed on the same HTTP/1 keep-alive connection. This causes Varnish to restart with a clean cache, causing a denial of service.\n    "
