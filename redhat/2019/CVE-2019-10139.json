    "\nA credential-protection flaw was found in cockpit-ovirt. During deployment, it generated an ansible variable file `/var/lib/ovirt-hosted-engine-setup/cockpit/ansibleVarFileXXXXXX.var` which contained both admin and appliance passwords as plain-text. Although these files are deleted at the end of the deployment procedure, a local attacker could exploit this flaw to access the passwords.\n    "
