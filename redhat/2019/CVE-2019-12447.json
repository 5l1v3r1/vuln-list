    "\nAn issue was discovered in GNOME gvfs 1.29.4 through 1.41.2. daemon/gvfsbackendadmin.c mishandles file ownership because setfsuid is not used.\n    ",
    "\nIt was discovered that gvfs incorrectly set the ownership of files handled by the admin:// backend. An attacker could abuse this flaw when the admin:// backend is used and a file owned by root is copied somewhere else, or when a regular file is copied in a directory owned by root. The attacker would have access to the target files with the ability to read and write in those instances.\n    "
