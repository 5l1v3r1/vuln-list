    "A heap-based buffer overflow was discovered in OpenSLP in the way the slpd service processes URLs in service request messages. A remote unauthenticated attacker could register a service with a specially crafted URL that, when used during a service request message, would trigger the flaw and cause the program to crash or to remotely execute code with the privileges of the slpd service."
