    "\nA certificate-validation error has been found in Octavia's amphora-agent, where an attacker with management-network access could bypass an amphora's client-certificate based authentication. Because the agent's HTTP server (gunicorn) had 'cert_reqs' set to 'True' instead of 'ssl.CERT_REQUIRED', information could be retrieved or configuration updated without a client certificate.\n    "
