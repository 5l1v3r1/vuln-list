  "statement": "\nThis flaw has a lower impact on Red Hat Enterprise Linux because the ntfs-3g tool is run in a supermin appliance, which is similar to a virtual machine instantiated on the fly, and it does not have the SUID bit set. Thus an attacker is very limited on what he can do to the vulnerable system.\n    ",
