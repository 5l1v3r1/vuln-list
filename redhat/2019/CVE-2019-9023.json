    "\nAn issue was discovered in PHP before 5.6.40, 7.x before 7.1.26, 7.2.x before 7.2.14, and 7.3.x before 7.3.1. A number of heap-based buffer over-read instances are present in mbstring regular expression functions when supplied with invalid multibyte data. These occur in ext/mbstring/oniguruma/regcomp.c, ext/mbstring/oniguruma/regexec.c, ext/mbstring/oniguruma/regparse.c, ext/mbstring/oniguruma/enc/unicode.c, and ext/mbstring/oniguruma/src/utf32_be.c when a multibyte regular expression pattern contains invalid multibyte sequences.\n    "
