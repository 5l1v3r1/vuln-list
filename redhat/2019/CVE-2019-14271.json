    "\nIn Docker 19.03.x before 19.03.1 linked against the GNU C Library (aka glibc), code injection can occur when the nsswitch facility dynamically loads a library inside a chroot that contains the contents of the container.\n    ",
    "\nA flaw was discovered in Docker if it is compiled with Go 1.11. During a `docker cp` command, the nsswitch facility dynamically loads a library inside a chroot that contains the contents of the container. An attacker could abuse this flaw by executing code with the root privileges.\n    "
