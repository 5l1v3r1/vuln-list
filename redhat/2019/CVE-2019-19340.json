  "mitigation": "Issue could be mitigated by limiting the access of the interface to internal trusted networks, limiting the ports open and set the firewall with more restrictive rules. Some of these instructions are already suggested in the Ansible Tower documentation as part of the Ansible Tower Administration Guide. Issue could be also mitigated by deleting the guest default user by running the command \"rabbitmqctl delete_user guest\".",
