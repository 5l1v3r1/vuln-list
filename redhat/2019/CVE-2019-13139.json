    "\nA command injection flaw was discovered in Docker during the `docker build` command. By providing a specially crafted path argument for the container to build, it is possible to inject command options to the `git fetch`/`git checkout` commands that are executed by Docker and to execute code with the privileges of the user running Docker. A local attacker who can run `docker build` with a controlled build path, or a remote attacker who has control over the docker build path, could elevate their privileges or execute code.\n    "

The injected command options passed to `docker build` through the docker build path are handled by `git checkout` rather than `git fetch`, which provides limited options for an attacker to exploit. It is unlikely that code execution is possible, though it cannot be ruled out entirely.\n    ",
