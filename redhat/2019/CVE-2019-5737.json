  "details": [
    "\nIn Node.js including 6.x before 6.17.0, 8.x before 8.15.1, 10.x before 10.15.2, and 11.x before 11.10.1, an attacker can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by establishing an HTTP or HTTPS connection in keep-alive mode and by sending headers very slowly. This keeps the connection and associated resources alive for a long period of time. Potential attacks are mitigated by the use of a load balancer or other proxy layer. This vulnerability is an extension of CVE-2018-12121, addressed in November and impacts all active Node.js release lines including 6.x before 6.17.0, 8.x before 8.15.1, 10.x before 10.15.2, and 11.x before 11.10.1.\n    ",
    "\nIt was found that the original fix for Slowloris, CVE-2018-12122, was insufficient. It is possible to bypass the server's headersTimeout by sending two specially crafted HTTP requests in the same connection. An attacker could use this flaw to bypass Slowloris protection, resulting in a denial of service.\n    "
