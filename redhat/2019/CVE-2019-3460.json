    "\nA heap data infoleak in multiple locations including L2CAP_PARSE_CONF_RSP was found in the Linux kernel before 5.1-rc1.\n    ",
    "\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of logical link control and adaptation protocol (L2CAP), part of the Bluetooth stack in the l2cap_parse_conf_rsp and l2cap_parse_conf_req functions. An attacker with physical access within the range of standard Bluetooth transmission can create a specially crafted packet. The response to this specially crafted packet can contain part of the kernel stack which can be used in a further attack.\n    "
