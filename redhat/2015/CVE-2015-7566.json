    "\nThe clie_5_attach function in drivers/usb/serial/visor.c in the Linux kernel through 4.4.1 allows physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by inserting a USB device that lacks a bulk-out endpoint.\n    ",
    "\nA flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel visor driver handles certain invalid USB device descriptors. The driver assumes that the device always has at least one bulk OUT endpoint. By using a specially crafted USB device (without a bulk OUT endpoint), an unprivileged user with physical access could trigger a kernel NULL-pointer dereference and cause a system panic (denial of service).\n    "
