    "\nIt was discovered that when uploading a file using a multipart/form-data submission to the EAP Web Console, the Console was vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). This meant that an attacker could use the flaw together with a forgery attack to make changes to an authenticated instance.\n    "
