    "\nThe VNC websocket frame decoder in QEMU allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory and CPU consumption) via a large (1) websocket payload or (2) HTTP headers section.\n    ",

An attacker able to access a guest's VNC console could use this flaw to trigger a denial of service on the host by exhausting all available memory and CPU.\n    "
