  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "\nInteger underflow in the EVP_DecodeUpdate function in crypto/evp/encode.c in the base64-decoding implementation in OpenSSL before 0.9.8za, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0m, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1h allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted base64 data that triggers a buffer overflow.\n    ",
    "\nAn integer underflow flaw, leading to a buffer overflow, was found in the way OpenSSL decoded malformed Base64-encoded inputs. An attacker able to make an application using OpenSSL decode a specially crafted Base64-encoded input (such as a PEM file) could use this flaw to cause the application to crash. Note: this flaw is not exploitable via the TLS/SSL protocol because the data being transferred is not Base64-encoded.\n    "
