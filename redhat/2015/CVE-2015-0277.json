NOTE: this identifier has been SPLIT per ADT2 due to different vulnerability types. See CVE-2015-6254 for lack of validation for the Destination attribute in a Response element in a SAML assertion.\n    ",
    "\nA flaw was found in the way PicketLink's Service Provider and Identity Provider handled certain requests. A remote attacker could use this flaw to log to a victim's account via PicketLink.\n    "
