    "\nThe xsl_ext_function_php function in ext/xsl/xsltprocessor.c in PHP before 5.4.45, 5.5.x before 5.5.29, and 5.6.x before 5.6.13, when libxml2 before 2.9.2 is used, does not consider the possibility of a NULL valuePop return value before proceeding with a free operation during initial error checking, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via a crafted XML document, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-6838.\n    ",
    "\nA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the XSLTProcessor class in PHP. An attacker could use this flaw to cause a PHP application to crash if it performed Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) transformations using untrusted XSLT files and allowed the use of PHP functions to be used as XSLT functions within XSL stylesheets.\n    "
