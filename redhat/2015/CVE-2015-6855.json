    "\nhw/ide/core.c in QEMU does not properly restrict the commands accepted by an ATAPI device, which allows guest users to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via certain IDE commands, as demonstrated by a WIN_READ_NATIVE_MAX command to an empty drive, which triggers a divide-by-zero error and instance crash.\n    ",
    "\nIt has been discovered that a QEMU emulator built with IDE disk and CD/DVD-ROM emulation support is vulnerable to a divide-by-zero issue. The flaw could occur when executing IDE's WIN_READ_NATIVE_MAX command to determine the maximum size of a drive. A privileged user inside the guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU instance, resulting in a denial of service.\n    "
