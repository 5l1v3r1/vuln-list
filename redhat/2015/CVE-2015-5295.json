  "details": [
    "\nThe template-validate command in OpenStack Orchestration API (Heat) before 2015.1.3 (kilo) and 5.0.x before 5.0.1 (liberty) allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) or determine the existence of local files via the resource type in a template, as demonstrated by file:///dev/zero.\n    ",
    "\nA vulnerability was discovered in the OpenStack Orchestration service (heat), where a specially formatted template could be used to trick the heat-engine service into opening a local file. Although the file contents are never disclosed to the end user, an OpenStack-authenticated attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service or determine whether a given file name is present on the server.\n    "
