    "\nnet/ipv6/addrconf.c in the IPv6 stack in the Linux kernel before 4.0 does not validate attempted changes to the MTU value, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (packet loss) via a value that is (1) smaller than the minimum compliant value or (2) larger than the MTU of an interface, as demonstrated by a Router Advertisement (RA) message that is not validated by a daemon, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-0272.  NOTE: the scope of CVE-2015-0272 is limited to the NetworkManager product.\n    ",
    "\nIt was found that the Linux kernel's IPv6 network stack did not properly validate the value of the MTU variable when it was set. A remote attacker could potentially use this flaw to disrupt a target system's networking (packet loss) by setting an invalid MTU value, for example, via a NetworkManager daemon that is processing router advertisement packets running on the target system.\n    "
