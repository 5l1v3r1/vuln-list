  "mitigation": "\nUsers that do not want to upgrade can address the vulnerability in several ways, but these options will break any site plugin:\n\n* Set http.disable_sites to true in the elasticsearch.yml config file on any node with a site plugin, and restart the Elasticsearch node.\n\n* Use a firewall or proxy to block HTTP requests to /_plugin.\n\n* Uninstall all site plugins from all Elasticsearch nodes.\n\nFor Satellite 6.x and Sam 1.x you can simply firewall elasticsearch to trusted users only (e.g. root, katello, foreman).
