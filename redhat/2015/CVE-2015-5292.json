    "\nMemory leak in the Privilege Attribute Certificate (PAC) responder plugin (sssd_pac_plugin.so) in System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) 1.10 before 1.13.1 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a large number of logins that trigger parsing of PAC blobs during Kerberos authentication.\n    ",
    "\nIt was found that SSSD's Privilege Attribute Certificate (PAC) responder plug-in would leak a small amount of memory on each authentication request. A remote attacker could potentially use this flaw to exhaust all available memory on the system by making repeated requests to a Kerberized daemon application configured to authenticate using the PAC responder plug-in.\n    "
