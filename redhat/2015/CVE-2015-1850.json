  "details": [
    "\nA flaw was found in how the OpenStack Compute (nova) service handles the qemu-img functionality during a snapshot upload. An authenticated attacker could possibly use this flaw to trick Compute into disclosing any file to which the Compute service user has access. However, it is unlikely that the code path can currently be exploited by an attacker.\n    "
