    "\nThe lookupProviders function in providerMgr.c in sblim-sfcb 1.3.4 and 1.3.18 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via an empty className in a packet.\n    ",
    "\nA NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way the lookupProviders() function processed certain requests without \"className\" information. An authenticated remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service (sfcbd crash) by sending a specially crafted request.\n    "
