    "\nRace condition in a certain Red Hat patch to the PRNG lock implementation in the ssleay_rand_bytes function in OpenSSL, as distributed in openssl-1.0.1e-25.el7 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 and other products, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) by establishing many TLS sessions to a multithreaded server, leading to use of a negative value for a certain length field.\n    ",
    "\nA regression was found in the ssleay_rand_bytes() function in the versions of OpenSSL shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7. This regression could cause a multi-threaded application to crash.\n    "
