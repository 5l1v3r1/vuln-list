    "\nInteger overflow in the sg_start_req function in drivers/scsi/sg.c in the Linux kernel 2.6.x through 4.x before 4.1 allows local users to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via a large iov_count value in a write request.\n    ",
    "\nAn integer-overflow vulnerability was found in the scsi block-request handling code in function start_req().  A local attacker could use specially crafted IOV requests to overflow a counter used in bio_map_user_iov()'s page calculation, and write past the end of the array that contains kernel-page pointers.\n    "
