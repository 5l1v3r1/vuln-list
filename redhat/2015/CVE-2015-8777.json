    "\nThe process_envvars function in elf/rtld.c in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.23 allows local users to bypass a pointer-guarding protection mechanism via a zero value of the LD_POINTER_GUARD environment variable.\n    ",
    "\nIt was found that the dynamic loader did not sanitize the LD_POINTER_GUARD environment variable. An attacker could use this flaw to bypass the pointer guarding protection on set-user-ID or set-group-ID programs to execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running the application.\n    "

  "mitigation": "\nThe glibc pointer guard is a post-exploitation mitigation mechanism.  As such, it is only relevant if there are exploitable security vulnerabilities in the system.  Therefore, applying available security updates to the system is a possible mitigation for this issue.\n\nIn typical deployments, environment variables can only be set by users with shell access.  Restricting shell access to trusted users is another possible mitigation.\n    ",
