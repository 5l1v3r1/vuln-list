    "\nIt was found that the Windows Virtio NIC driver did not sufficiently sanitize the length of the incoming IP packets, as demonstrated by a packet with IP options present but the overall packet length not being adjusted to reflect the length of those options. A remote attacker able to send a specially crafted IP packet to the guest could use this flaw to crash that guest.\n    "
