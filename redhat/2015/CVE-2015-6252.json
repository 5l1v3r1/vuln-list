  "details": [
    "\nThe vhost_dev_ioctl function in drivers/vhost/vhost.c in the Linux kernel before 4.1.5 allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a VHOST_SET_LOG_FD ioctl call that triggers permanent file-descriptor allocation.\n    ",
    "\nA flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's vhost driver treated userspace provided log file descriptor when processing the VHOST_SET_LOG_FD ioctl command. The file descriptor was never released and continued to consume kernel memory. A privileged local user with access to the /dev/vhost-net files could use this flaw to create a denial-of-service attack.\n    "
