    "\nThe PKCS7_dataDecodefunction in crypto/pkcs7/pk7_doit.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8zg, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0s, 1.0.1 before 1.0.1n, and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2b allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via a PKCS#7 blob that uses ASN.1 encoding and lacks inner EncryptedContent data.\n    ",
    "\nA NULL pointer dereference was found in the way OpenSSL handled certain PKCS#7 inputs. An attacker able to make an application using OpenSSL verify, decrypt, or parse a specially crafted PKCS#7 input could cause that application to crash. TLS/SSL clients and servers using OpenSSL were not affected by this flaw.\n    "
