  "details": [
    "\nThe fuse_fill_write_pages function in fs/fuse/file.c in the Linux kernel before 4.4 allows local users to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a writev system call that triggers a zero length for the first segment of an iov.\n    ",
    "\nAn infinite-loop flaw was found in the kernel. When a local user calls the sys_writev syscall with a specially crafted sequence of iov structs, the fuse_fill_write_pages kernel function might never terminate, instead continuing in a tight loop.  This process cannot be terminated and requires a reboot.\n    "
