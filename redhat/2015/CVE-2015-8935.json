    "\nThe header() PHP function allowed header stings containing line break followed by a space or tab, as allowed by RFC 2616. Certain browsers handled the continuation line as new header, making it possible to conduct a HTTP response splitting attack against such browsers. The header() function was updated to follow RFC 7230 and not allow any line breaks.\n    "
