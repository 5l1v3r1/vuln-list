    "\nThe svn_repos_trace_node_locations function in Apache Subversion before 1.7.21 and 1.8.x before 1.8.14, when path-based authorization is used, allows remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive path information by reading the history of a node that has been moved from a hidden path.\n    ",
    "\nIt was found that when an SVN server (both svnserve and httpd with the mod_dav_svn module) searched the history of a file or a directory, it would disclose its location in the repository if that file or directory was not readable (for example, if it had been moved).\n    "
