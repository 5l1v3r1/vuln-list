    "\nThe stack randomization feature in the Linux kernel before 3.19.1 on 64-bit platforms uses incorrect data types for the results of bitwise left-shift operations, which makes it easier for attackers to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism by predicting the address of the top of the stack, related to the randomize_stack_top function in fs/binfmt_elf.c and the stack_maxrandom_size function in arch/x86/mm/mmap.c.\n    ",
    "\nAn integer overflow flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel randomized the stack for processes on certain 64-bit architecture systems, such as x86-64, causing the stack entropy to be reduced by four.\n    "
