    "\nThe PKCS#7 implementation in OpenSSL before 0.9.8zf, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0r, 1.0.1 before 1.0.1m, and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2a does not properly handle a lack of outer ContentInfo, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) by leveraging an application that processes arbitrary PKCS#7 data and providing malformed data with ASN.1 encoding, related to crypto/pkcs7/pk7_doit.c and crypto/pkcs7/pk7_lib.c.\n    ",
    "\nA NULL pointer dereference was found in the way OpenSSL handled certain PKCS#7 inputs. An attacker able to make an application using OpenSSL verify, decrypt, or parse a specially crafted PKCS#7 input could cause that application to crash. TLS/SSL clients and servers using OpenSSL were not affected by this flaw.\n    "
