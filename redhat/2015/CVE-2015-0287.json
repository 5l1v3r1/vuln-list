    "\nThe ASN1_item_ex_d2i function in crypto/asn1/tasn_dec.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8zf, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0r, 1.0.1 before 1.0.1m, and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2a does not reinitialize CHOICE and ADB data structures, which might allow attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid write operation and memory corruption) by leveraging an application that relies on ASN.1 structure reuse.\n    ",
