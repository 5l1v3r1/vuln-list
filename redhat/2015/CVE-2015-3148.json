  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "\ncURL and libcurl 7.10.6 through 7.41.0 do not properly re-use authenticated Negotiate connections, which allows remote attackers to connect as other users via a request.\n    ",
    "\nIt was discovered that libcurl could incorrectly reuse Negotiate authenticated HTTP connections for subsequent requests. If an application using libcurl established a Negotiate authenticated HTTP connection to a server and sent subsequent requests with different credentials, the connection could be re-used with the initial set of credentials instead of using the new ones.\n    "
