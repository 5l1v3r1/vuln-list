    "\nThe default configuration in Apache Cassandra 1.2.0 through 1.2.19, 2.0.0 through 2.0.13, and 2.1.0 through 2.1.3 binds an unauthenticated JMX/RMI interface to all network interfaces, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary Java code via an RMI request.\n    ",
    "\nIt was found that Apache Cassandra bound an unauthenticated JMX/RMI interface to all network interfaces. A remote attacker able to access the RMI, an API for the transport and remote execution of serialized Java, could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code as the user running Cassandra.\n    "
