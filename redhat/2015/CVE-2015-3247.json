    "\nA race condition flaw, leading to a heap-based memory corruption, was found in spice's worker_update_monitors_config() function, which runs under the QEMU-KVM context on the host. A user in a guest could leverage this flaw to crash the host QEMU-KVM process or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the host QEMU-KVM process.\n    "
