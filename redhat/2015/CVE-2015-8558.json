  "details": [
    "\nThe ehci_process_itd function in hw/usb/hcd-ehci.c in QEMU allows local guest OS administrators to cause a denial of service (infinite loop and CPU consumption) via a circular isochronous transfer descriptor (iTD) list.\n    ",
    "\nAn infinite-loop issue was found in the QEMU emulator built with USB EHCI emulation support. The flaw occurred during communication between the host controller interface(EHCI) and a respective device driver. These two communicate using an isochronous transfer descriptor list(iTD); an infinite loop unfolded if there was a closed loop in the list. A privileged user inside a guest could use this flaw to consume excessive resources and cause denial of service.\n    "
