    "\nRace condition in the relinquish_memory function in arch/arm/domain.c in Xen 4.6.x and earlier allows local domains with partial management control to cause a denial of service (host crash) via vectors involving the destruction of a domain and using XENMEM_decrease_reservation to reduce the memory of the domain.\n    "

  "mitigation": "\nThere is no known mitigation. Switching from disaggregated to a non-disaggregated operation does NOT mitigate these vulnerabilities. Rather, it simply recategorises the vulnerability to hostile management code, regarding it \"as designed\"; thus it merely reclassifies these issues as \"not a bug\". Users and vendors of disaggregated systems should not change their configuration.\n    ",
