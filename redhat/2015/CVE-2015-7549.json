  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "\nThe MSI-X MMIO support in hw/pci/msix.c in QEMU (aka Quick Emulator) allows local guest OS privileged users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and QEMU process crash) by leveraging failure to define the .write method.\n    ",
    "\nA NULL pointer dereference vulnerability was found in the QEMU emulator built with PCI MSI-X support. Because MSI-X MMIO support did not define the .write method, when the controller tried to write to the pending bit array(PBA) memory region, a segmentation fault occurred. A privileged attacker inside the guest could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process resulting in denial of service.\n    "
