    "\nThe TripleO Heat templates (tripleo-heat-templates) do not properly order the Identity Service (keystone) before the OpenStack Object Storage (Swift) staticweb middleware in the swiftproxy pipeline when the staticweb middleware is enabled, which might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from private containers via unspecified vectors.\n    ",
    "\nA flaw was discovered in the pipeline ordering of OpenStack Object Storage's staticweb middleware in the swiftproxy configuration generated from the openstack-tripleo-heat-templates package (OpenStack director). The staticweb middleware was incorrectly configured before the Identity Service, and under some conditions an attacker could use this flaw to gain unauthenticated access to private data.\n    "
