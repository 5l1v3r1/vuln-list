    "\nThe collect_mounts function in fs/namespace.c in the Linux kernel before 4.0.5 does not properly consider that it may execute after a path has been unmounted, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) by leveraging user-namespace root access for an MNT_DETACH umount2 system call.\n    ",
    "\nA flaw was discovered in the kernel's collect_mounts function. If the kernel's audit subsystem called collect_mounts to audit an unmounted path, it could panic the system. With this flaw, an unprivileged user could call umount(MNT_DETACH) to launch a denial-of-service attack.\n    "
