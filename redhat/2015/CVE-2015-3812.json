  "mitigation": "\nThis flaw can be mitigated in wireshark by disabling the X11 protocol dissector. In wireshark GUI application click on Analyze-\u003eEnabled Protocols and search for \"X11\" and disable in. When using \"tshark\", the text interface, create a file called \"disabled_protos\" in the preferences folder (normally .wireshark folder in the home directory of the user running wireshark) and add \"X11\" to it. This should disable the X11 protocol.\n    ",
