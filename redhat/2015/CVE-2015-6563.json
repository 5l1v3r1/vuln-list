  "details": [
    "\nThe monitor component in sshd in OpenSSH before 7.0 on non-OpenBSD platforms accepts extraneous username data in MONITOR_REQ_PAM_INIT_CTX requests, which allows local users to conduct impersonation attacks by leveraging any SSH login access in conjunction with control of the sshd uid to send a crafted MONITOR_REQ_PWNAM request, related to monitor.c and monitor_wrap.c.\n    ",
    "\nA flaw was found in the way OpenSSH handled PAM authentication when using privilege separation. An attacker with valid credentials on the system and able to fully compromise a non-privileged pre-authentication process using a different flaw could use this flaw to authenticate as other users.\n    "
