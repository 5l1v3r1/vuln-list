    "\nA heap-based buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the QEMU emulator built with the Q35-chipset-based PC system emulator. During VM-guest migration, more data (8 bytes) is moved than the allocated memory area. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to corrupt the VM guest image, which could potentially lead to a denial of service.\n    "
