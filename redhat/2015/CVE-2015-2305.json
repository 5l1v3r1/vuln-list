    "\nInteger overflow in the regcomp implementation in the Henry Spencer BSD regex library (aka rxspencer) alpha3.8.g5 on 32-bit platforms, as used in NetBSD through 6.1.5 and other products, might allow context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a large regular expression that leads to a heap-based buffer overflow.\n    ",
    "\nA heap buffer overflow flaw was found in the regcomp() function of Henry Spencer's regular expression library. An attacker able to make an application process a specially crafted regular expression pattern with the regcomp() function could cause that application to crash and possibly execute arbitrary code.\n    "
