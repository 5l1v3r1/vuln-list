  "details": [
    "\nInteger overflow in the _IO_wstr_overflow function in libio/wstrops.c in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.22 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via vectors related to computing a size in bytes, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.\n    ",
    "\nAn integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was found in glibc's _IO_wstr_overflow() function. An attacker able to make an application call this function could use this flaw to crash that application or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running the application.\n    "
