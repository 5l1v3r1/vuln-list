    "\nA flaw has been discovered in the QEMU emulator built with Virtual Network Device(virtio-net) support. If the guest's virtio-net driver did not support big or mergeable receive buffers, an issue could occur while receiving large packets over the tuntap/ macvtap interfaces. An attacker on the local network could use this flaw to disable the guest's networking; the user could send a large number of jumbo frames to the guest, which could exhaust all receive buffers, and lead to a denial of service.\n    "
