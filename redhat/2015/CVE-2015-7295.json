    "\nhw/virtio/virtio.c in the Virtual Network Device (virtio-net) support in QEMU, when big or mergeable receive buffers are not supported, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (guest network consumption) via a flood of jumbo frames on the (1) tuntap or (2) macvtap interface.\n    ",
    "\nA flaw has been discovered in the QEMU emulator built with Virtual Network Device(virtio-net) support. If the guest's virtio-net driver did not support big or mergeable receive buffers, an issue could occur while receiving large packets over the tuntap/ macvtap interfaces. An attacker on the local network could use this flaw to disable the guest's networking; the user could send a large number of jumbo frames to the guest, which could exhaust all receive buffers, and lead to a denial of service.\n    "
