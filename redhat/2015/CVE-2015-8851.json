    "\nIt was found that NodeJS node-uuid used Math.random() to create a GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) which does not provide enough entropy (on some platforms it only provides 32 bits) which can result in collisions of GUIDs. An attacker could use this to guess GUID values and leverage further attacks against a system using node-uuid.\n    "
