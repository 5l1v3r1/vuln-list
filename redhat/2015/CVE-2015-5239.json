    "\nAn integer overflow issue was found in the VNC display driver of the QEMU emulator, which could be used by a privileged guest user to create a denial of service attack. The overflow occurred when processing a CLIENT_CUT_TEXT message with too large a payload size. The integer overflow led to an infinite loop inside the VNC driver, eventually crashing the QEMU process on the host.\n    "
