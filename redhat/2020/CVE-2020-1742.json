    "An insecure modification vulnerability flaw was found in containers using nmstate/kubernetes-nmstate-handle. Containers can modify the permissions of /etc/passwd to make them modifiable by users other than root. An attacker with access to the running container can exploit this to modify /etc/passwd to add a user and escalate their privileges. This CVE is specific to the openshift/jenkins-slave-base-rhel7-container."
