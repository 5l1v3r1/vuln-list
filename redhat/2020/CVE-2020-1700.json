    "A flaw was found in the way the Ceph RGW Beast front-end handles unexpected disconnects. An authenticated attacker can abuse this flaw by making multiple disconnect attempts resulting in a permanent leak of a socket connection by radosgw. This flaw could lead to a denial of service condition by pile up of CLOSE_WAIT sockets, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources, preventing legitimate users from connecting to the system."
