  "details": [
    "Intel microprocessors contain an implementation weakness that allows for an 'inverse MDS' style attack to be performed during store operations (writes to memory) and are stuffed maliciously into microarchitectural buffers from which unsuspecting victim code will later (speculatively) execute them. This allows an attacker to control and steer (speculative) execution, possibly allowing them to exploit gadgets in existing code to leak sensitive data."
