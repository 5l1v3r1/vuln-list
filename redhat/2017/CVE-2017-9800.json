    "\nA maliciously constructed svn+ssh:// URL would cause Subversion clients before 1.8.19, 1.9.x before 1.9.7, and 1.10.0.x through 1.10.0-alpha3 to run an arbitrary shell command. Such a URL could be generated by a malicious server, by a malicious user committing to a honest server (to attack another user of that server's repositories), or by a proxy server. The vulnerability affects all clients, including those that use file://, http://, and plain (untunneled) svn://.\n    ",
    "\nA shell command injection flaw related to the handling of \"svn+ssh\" URLs has been discovered in Subversion. An attacker could use this flaw to execute shell commands with the privileges of the user running the Subversion client, for example when performing a \"checkout\" or \"update\" action on a malicious repository, or a legitimate repository containing a malicious commit.\n    "
