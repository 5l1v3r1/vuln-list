    "\nRace condition in fs/timerfd.c in the Linux kernel before 4.10.15 allows local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (list corruption or use-after-free) via simultaneous file-descriptor operations that leverage improper might_cancel queueing.\n    ",
    "\nA race condition was found in the Linux kernel before version 4.11-rc1 in 'fs/timerfd.c' file which allows a local user to cause a kernel list corruption or use-after-free via simultaneous operations with a file descriptor which leverage improper 'might_cancel' queuing.  An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service of the system. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although we believe it is unlikely.\n    "
