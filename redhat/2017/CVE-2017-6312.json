    "\nInteger overflow in io-ico.c in gdk-pixbuf allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault and application crash) via a crafted image entry offset in an ICO file, which triggers an out-of-bounds read, related to compiler optimizations.\n    ",
    "\nAn out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the way GdkPixbuf handled ICO format files. A maliciously crafted ICO file could cause the application using GdkPixbuf to crash.\n    "
