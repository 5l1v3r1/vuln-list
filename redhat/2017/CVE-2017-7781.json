    "\nAn error occurs in the elliptic curve point addition algorithm that uses mixed Jacobian-affine coordinates where it can yield a result \"POINT_AT_INFINITY\" when it should not. A man-in-the-middle attacker could use this to interfere with a connection, resulting in an attacked party computing an incorrect shared secret. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 55.\n    "
