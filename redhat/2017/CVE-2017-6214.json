  "details": [
    "\nThe tcp_splice_read function in net/ipv4/tcp.c in the Linux kernel before 4.9.11 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop and soft lockup) via vectors involving a TCP packet with the URG flag.\n    ",
    "\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel's handling of packets with the URG flag. Applications using the splice() and tcp_splice_read() functionality could allow a remote attacker to force the kernel to enter a condition in which it could loop indefinitely.\n    "
