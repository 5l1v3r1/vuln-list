  "details": [
    "\nAn SSRF issue was discovered in OpenStack Glance before Newton. The 'copy_from' feature in the Image Service API v1 allowed an attacker to perform masked network port scans. With v1, it is possible to create images with a URL such as 'http://localhost:22'. This could then allow an attacker to enumerate internal network details while appearing masked, since the scan would appear to originate from the Glance Image service.\n    ",

This could allow an attacker to enumerate internal network details while appearing masked, because the scan appears to originate from the Image Service. This is classified as a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). Note: Some knowledge of the internal network might be necessary to exploit this flaw internally (apart from localhost).\n    "
