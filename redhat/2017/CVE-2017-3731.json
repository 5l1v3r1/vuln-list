    "\nIf an SSL/TLS server or client is running on a 32-bit host, and a specific cipher is being used, then a truncated packet can cause that server or client to perform an out-of-bounds read, usually resulting in a crash. For OpenSSL 1.1.0, the crash can be triggered when using CHACHA20/POLY1305; users should upgrade to 1.1.0d. For Openssl 1.0.2, the crash can be triggered when using RC4-MD5; users who have not disabled that algorithm should update to 1.0.2k.\n    ",
    "\nAn integer underflow leading to an out of bounds read flaw was found in OpenSSL. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to crash a 32-bit TLS/SSL server or client using OpenSSL if it used the RC4-MD5 cipher suite.\n    "
