    "\nThe XML-RPC server in supervisor before 3.0.1, 3.1.x before 3.1.4, 3.2.x before 3.2.4, and 3.3.x before 3.3.3 allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary commands via a crafted XML-RPC request, related to nested supervisord namespace lookups.\n    ",
    "\nA vulnerability was found in the XML-RPC interface in supervisord. When processing malformed commands, an attacker can cause arbitrary shell commands to be executed on the server as the same user as supervisord. Exploitation requires the attacker to first be authenticated to the supervisord service.\n    "
