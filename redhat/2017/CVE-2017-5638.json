    "\nThe Jakarta Multipart parser in Apache Struts 2 2.3.x before 2.3.32 and 2.5.x before 2.5.10.1 has incorrect exception handling and error-message generation during file-upload attempts, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a crafted Content-Type, Content-Disposition, or Content-Length HTTP header, as exploited in the wild in March 2017 with a Content-Type header containing a #cmd= string.\n    ",
    "\nA flaw was reported in Apache Struts 2 that could allow an attacker to perform remote code execution with a malicious Content-Type value.\n    "

  "statement": "\nThis issue did not affect any of the Red Hat products as they did not include the Apache Struts 2 package. Additionally it does not appear that struts 1 is affected by this vulnerability (the affected code does not appear to be present in struts 1). Additionally it does not appear that Red Hat has backported any code from struts 2 to struts 1 as the code bases are quite different and backporting any significant code would be a major effort with questionable results due to compatibility issues.\n    ",
