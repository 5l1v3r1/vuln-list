    "\nThe cdc_parse_cdc_header() function in 'drivers/usb/core/message.c' in the Linux kernel, before 4.13.6, allows local users to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted USB device. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although we believe it is unlikely.\n    "
