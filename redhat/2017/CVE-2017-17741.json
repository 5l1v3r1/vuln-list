  "details": [
    "\nThe KVM implementation in the Linux kernel through 4.14.7 allows attackers to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory, aka a write_mmio stack-based out-of-bounds read, related to arch/x86/kvm/x86.c and include/trace/events/kvm.h.\n    ",
    "\nLinux kernel compiled with the KVM virtualization (CONFIG_KVM) support is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read access issue. It could occur when emulating vmcall instructions invoked by a guest. A guest user/process could use this flaw to disclose kernel memory bytes.\n    "
