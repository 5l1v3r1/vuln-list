  "mitigation": "\nThis issue affects processing of XML content from an untrusted source using a javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory. The only safe way to process untrusted XML content with a TransformerFactory is to use the StAX API. StAX is a safe implementation on EAP 7.0.x because the XML content is not read in it's entirety in order to parse it. As a developer using StAX, you decide which XML stream events you want to react to, so XXE control constructs won't be processed automatically by the parser.\n    ",
