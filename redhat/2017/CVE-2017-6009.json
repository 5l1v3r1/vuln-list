    "\nAn issue was discovered in icoutils 0.31.1. A buffer overflow was observed in the \"decode_ne_resource_id\" function in the \"restable.c\" source file. This is happening because the \"len\" parameter for memcpy is not checked for size and thus becomes a negative integer in the process, resulting in a failed memcpy. This affects wrestool.\n    ",
    "\nA vulnerability was found in icoutils, in the wrestool program. An attacker could create a crafted executable that, when read by wrestool, could result in memory corruption leading to a crash or potential code execution.\n    "
