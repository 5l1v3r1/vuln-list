    "\nThe Jenkins 2.73.1 and earlier, 2.83 and earlier default form control for passwords and other secrets, \u003cf:password/\u003e, supports form validation (e.g. for API keys). The form validation AJAX requests were sent via GET, which could result in secrets being logged to a HTTP access log in non-default configurations of Jenkins, and made available to users with access to these log files. Form validation for \u003cf:password/\u003e is now always sent via POST, which is typically not logged.\n    "
