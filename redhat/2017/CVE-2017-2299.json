  "details": [
    "\nVersions of the puppetlabs-apache module prior to 1.11.1 and 2.1.0 make it very easy to accidentally misconfigure TLS trust. If you specify the `ssl_ca` parameter but do not specify the `ssl_certs_dir` parameter, a default will be provided for the `ssl_certs_dir` that will trust certificates from any of the system-trusted certificate authorities. This did not affect FreeBSD.\n    "
