  "details": [
    "\nPECL in the download utility class in the Installer in PEAR Base System v1.10.1 does not validate file types and filenames after a redirect, which allows remote HTTP servers to overwrite files via crafted responses, as demonstrated by a .htaccess overwrite.\n    ",
    "\nA vulnerability was found in php-pear where if a malicious server responded to a pear\n    "
  ],
  "mitigation": "\nThis vulnerability only allows files in the current directory to be overwritten, so using `pear download` in a temporary directory effectively mitigates the risk of a dangerous file overwrite occurring.\n    ",
