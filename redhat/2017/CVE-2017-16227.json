  "details": [
    "\nThe aspath_put function in bgpd/bgp_aspath.c in Quagga before 1.2.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (session drop) via BGP UPDATE messages, because AS_PATH size calculation for long paths counts certain bytes twice and consequently constructs an invalid message.\n    ",
    "\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way the bgpd daemon in Quagga handled the processing of large BGP update messages. A remote, previously trusted attacker could potentially use this flaw to cause bgpd to terminate existing BGP sessions, thereby leading to denial of service.\n    "
