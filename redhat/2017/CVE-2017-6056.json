It was corrected in products like Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 and JBoss Enterprise Web Server 3 prior to the fix for CVE-2016-6816 being applied.  This was not the case for JBoss Enterprise Application Server 6.  As a result, only EAP 6.4.13 is vulnerable to this issue and 6.4.14 corrects it.  For further information, refer to https://access.redhat.com/articles/2991951\n    ",
