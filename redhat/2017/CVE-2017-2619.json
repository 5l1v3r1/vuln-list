This prevents SMB1 clients from creating symlinks on the exported file system using SMB1.\n\nHowever, if the same region of the file system is also exported using NFS, NFS clients can create symlinks that potentially can also hit the race condition. For non-patched versions of Samba we recommend only exporting areas of the file system by either SMB or NFS, not both.\n    ",
