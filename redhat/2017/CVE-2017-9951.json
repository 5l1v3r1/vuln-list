  "cwe": "CWE-119",
  "details": [
    "\nThe try_read_command function in memcached.c in memcached before 1.4.39 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) via a request to add/set a key, which makes a comparison between signed and unsigned int and triggers a heap-based buffer over-read. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-8705.\n    "

  "mitigation": "\nThis flaw is in the memcached binary protocol. If your client programs only use the ASCII protocol when communicating with memcached, you can disable the binary protocol and protect against this flaw by adding \"-B ascii\" to OPTIONS in /etc/sysconfig/memcached.\n    ",
