  "details": [
    "\nThe mq_notify function in the Linux kernel through 4.11.9 does not set the sock pointer to NULL upon entry into the retry logic. During a user-space close of a Netlink socket, it allows attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free) or possibly have unspecified other impact.\n    ",
    "\nA use-after-free flaw was found in the Netlink functionality of the Linux kernel networking subsystem. Due to the insufficient cleanup in the mq_notify function, a local attacker could potentially use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system.\n    "
