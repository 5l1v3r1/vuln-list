  "details": [
    "\nDuring TLS 1.2 exchanges, handshake hashes are generated which point to a message buffer. This saved data is used for later messages but in some cases, the handshake transcript can exceed the space available in the current buffer, causing the allocation of a new buffer. This leaves a pointer pointing to the old, freed buffer, resulting in a use-after-free when handshake hashes are then calculated afterwards. This can result in a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 56, Firefox ESR \u003c 52.4, and Thunderbird \u003c 52.4.\n    ",
    "\nA use-after-free flaw was found in the TLS 1.2 implementation in the NSS library when client authentication was used. A malicious client could use this flaw to cause an application compiled against NSS to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the permission of the user running the application.\n    "
