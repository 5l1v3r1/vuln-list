    "\nThe KEYS subsystem in the Linux kernel through 4.13.7 mishandles use of add_key for a key that already exists but is uninstantiated, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted system call.\n    ",
    "\nA vulnerability was found in the key management subsystem of the Linux kernel. An update on an uninstantiated key could cause a kernel panic, leading to denial of service (DoS).\n    "
