    "\nsound/core/timer.c in the Linux kernel before 4.11.5 is vulnerable to a data race in the ALSA /dev/snd/timer driver resulting in local users being able to read information belonging to other users, i.e., uninitialized memory contents may be disclosed when a read and an ioctl happen at the same time.\n    ",
    "\nIt was found that the timer functionality in the Linux kernel ALSA subsystem is prone to a race condition between read and ioctl system call handlers, resulting in an uninitialized memory disclosure to user space. A local user could use this flaw to read information belonging to other users.\n    "
