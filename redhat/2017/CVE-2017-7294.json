    "\nThe vmw_surface_define_ioctl function in drivers/gpu/drm/vmwgfx/vmwgfx_surface.c in the Linux kernel through 4.10.6 does not validate addition of certain levels data, which allows local users to trigger an integer overflow and out-of-bounds write, and cause a denial of service (system hang or crash) or possibly gain privileges, via a crafted ioctl call for a /dev/dri/renderD* device.\n    ",
    "\nAn out-of-bounds write vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's vmw_surface_define_ioctl() function, in the 'drivers/gpu/drm/vmwgfx/vmwgfx_surface.c' file. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although we believe it is unlikely.\n    "
