  "details": [
    "\nHammer CLI, a CLI utility for Foreman, before version 0.10.0, did not explicitly set the verify_ssl flag for apipie-bindings that disable it by default. As a result the server certificates are not checked and connections are prone to man-in-the-middle attacks.\n    ",
    "\nIt was found that the hammer_cli command line client disables SSL/TLS certificate verification by default. A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker could use this flaw to spoof a valid certificate.\n    "
