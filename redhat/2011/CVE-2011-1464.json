  "statement": "\nRed Hat does not consider this flaw to be a security issue. It is improbable that a script would accept untrusted user input or unvalidated script input data to the strval() function. Input passed to the functions is therefore under the full control of the script author and no trust boundary is crossed. As well, an administrator would have to excessively increase the precision settings in order to trigger this flaw.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 5: \nThis vulnerability has been rated as having a security impact of Low. After evaluation and in accordance with the criteria noted in the product support life cycle, there are no plans to address this issue in an upcoming release. Please contact Red Hat Support for further information.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 6: \nThis vulnerability has been rated as having a security impact of Low.
