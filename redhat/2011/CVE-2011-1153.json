  "statement": "\nRed Hat does not consider this flaw to be a security issue.  It is improbable that a script would accept untrusted user input or unvalidated script input data as a PHAR archive file name to load.  The file name passed to the PHAR-handling functions is therefore under the full control of the script author and no trust boundary is crossed.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (php53):\nThis vulnerability has been rated as having a security impact of Moderate. After evaluation and in accordance with the criteria noted in the product support life cycle, there are no plans to address this issue in an upcoming release.
