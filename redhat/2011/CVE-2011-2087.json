  "statement": "\nA previous statement by Red Hat related to this CVE, prior to August 2019, said that Apache Struts 2 is not included in any Red Hat products. This earlier statement was incorrect. While Struts 2 is not actively compiled, shipped, used, or enabled in any Red Hat provided final products, and does not cause any vulnerability in the product, struts2-core jars have been included in some products' source code packages. The inclusion was part of an import of the Google Guice repository, which includes struts2-core. Customers that build artefacts from our source code could be at risk. Red Hat will remove these artefacts from source code in future releases.\n\nThe products that included the Struts 2 artefacts in their source jars:\nFuse Service Works 6.0.0\nSingle Sign On 7.3.0+\n\nIf you have used the source package from one of these products to build artefacts on your system, you should do the following to remove potentially affected jars:\n1. Run 'find . -name struts2*.jar' under the source location\n2. Remove any files found\nThis will not affect the product, as the jar is included with the source of google-guice, but no functionality requiring struts2 is implemented.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 5: \nThis vulnerability has been rated as having a security impact of Moderate. After evaluation and in accordance with the criteria noted in the product support life cycle, there are no plans to address this issue in an upcoming release. Please contact Red Hat Support for further information.\n\nRed Hat JBoss EWS 1: \nThis vulnerability has been rated as having a security impact of Moderate. After evaluation and in accordance with the criteria noted in the product support life cycle, there are no plans to address this issue in an upcoming release. Please contact Red Hat Support for further information.\n\nRed Hat Satellite 5.4: \nThis vulnerability has been rated as having a security impact of Moderate. After evaluation and in accordance with the criteria noted in the product support life cycle, there are no plans to address this issue in an upcoming release.
