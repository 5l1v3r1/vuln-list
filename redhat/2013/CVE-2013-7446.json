    "\nUse-after-free vulnerability in net/unix/af_unix.c in the Linux kernel before 4.3.3 allows local users to bypass intended AF_UNIX socket permissions or cause a denial of service (panic) via crafted epoll_ctl calls.\n    ",
    "\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of Unix sockets.  A server polling for client-socket data could put the peer socket on a wait list; the peer socket could then close the connection, making the reference on the wait list no longer valid.  This could lead to bypassing the permissions on a Unix socket and packets being injected into the stream, and could also panic the machine (denial of service).\n    "
