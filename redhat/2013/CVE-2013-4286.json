NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2005-2090.\n    ",
    "\nIt was found that when Tomcat / JBoss Web processed a series of HTTP requests in which at least one request contained either multiple content-length headers, or one content-length header with a chunked transfer-encoding header, Tomcat / JBoss Web would incorrectly handle the request. A remote attacker could use this flaw to poison a web cache, perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or obtain sensitive information from other requests.\n    "
