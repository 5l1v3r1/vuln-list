  "statement": "\nThis issue did affect the versions of the kernel-xen package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.\n\nThis issue did not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.\n\nThe risks associated with fixing this bug are greater than its security impact. This issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future kernel-xen updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. Using fully virtualized (HVM) guests, or PV guests with trusted kernel/administrator avoids this issue.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 5: \nThis vulnerability has been rated as having a security impact of Moderate. After evaluation and in accordance with the criteria noted in the product support life cycle, there are no plans to address this issue in an upcoming release. Please contact Red Hat Support for further information.\n    ",
