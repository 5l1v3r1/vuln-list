  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "\nThe TLS implementation in the Bouncy Castle Java library before 1.48 and C# library before 1.8 does not properly consider timing side-channel attacks on a noncompliant MAC check operation during the processing of malformed CBC padding, which allows remote attackers to conduct distinguishing attacks and plaintext-recovery attacks via statistical analysis of timing data for crafted packets, a related issue to CVE-2013-0169.\n    ",
    "\nIt was discovered that bouncycastle leaked timing information when decrypting TLS/SSL protocol encrypted records when CBC-mode cipher suites were used. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to retrieve plain text from the encrypted packets by using a TLS/SSL server as a padding oracle.\n    "
