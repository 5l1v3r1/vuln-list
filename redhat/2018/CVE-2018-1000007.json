  "details": [
    "\nlibcurl 7.1 through 7.57.0 might accidentally leak authentication data to third parties. When asked to send custom headers in its HTTP requests, libcurl will send that set of headers first to the host in the initial URL but also, if asked to follow redirects and a 30X HTTP response code is returned, to the host mentioned in URL in the `Location:` response header value. Sending the same set of headers to subsequent hosts is in particular a problem for applications that pass on custom `Authorization:` headers, as this header often contains privacy sensitive information or data that could allow others to impersonate the libcurl-using client's request.\n    ",
    "\nIt was found that curl and libcurl might send their Authentication header to a third party HTTP server upon receiving an HTTP REDIRECT reply. This could leak authentication token to external entities.\n    "
  ],
  "mitigation": "\nBy default, curl and libcurl will not follow redirect requests.\nThis flaw happens only when curl or libcurl are explicitly requested to follow redirects (option --location in curl, and CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION in libcurl).\nTo mitigate this, it is possible to prevent the automated following of redirects, replacing it by manual redirects (and remove the authentication header), for example.\n    ",
