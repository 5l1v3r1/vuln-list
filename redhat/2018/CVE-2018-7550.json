    "\nQuick Emulator (QEMU), compiled with the PC System Emulator with multiboot feature support, is vulnerable to an OOB r/w memory access issue. The issue could occur while loading a kernel image during the guest boot, if mh_load_end_addr address is greater than the mh_bss_end_addr address. A user or process could use this flaw to potentially achieve arbitrary code execution on a host.\n    "
