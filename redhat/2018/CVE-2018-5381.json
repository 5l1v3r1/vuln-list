    "\nThe Quagga BGP daemon (bgpd) prior to version 1.2.3 has a bug in its parsing of \"Capabilities\" in BGP OPEN messages, in the bgp_packet.c:bgp_capability_msg_parse function. The parser can enter an infinite loop on invalid capabilities if a Multi-Protocol capability does not have a recognized AFI/SAFI, causing a denial of service.\n    ",
    "\nAn infinite loop vulnerability was discovered in Quagga. A BGP peer could send specially crafted packets that would cause the daemon to enter an infinite loop, denying service and consuming CPU until it is restarted.\n    "
