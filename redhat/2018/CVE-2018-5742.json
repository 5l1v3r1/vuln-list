As this configuration should be rare in production instances of bind, it is unlikely that most servers will be exploitable. The debug level of the bind server can be checked via the rndc status command, which will return the current trace level as \"debug level\". A value of 10 or above would most likely make this flaw exploitable.\n    ",
