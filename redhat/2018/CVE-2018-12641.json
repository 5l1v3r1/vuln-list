  "details": [
    "\nAn issue was discovered in arm_pt in cplus-dem.c in GNU libiberty, as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.30. Stack Exhaustion occurs in the C++ demangling functions provided by libiberty, and there are recursive stack frames: demangle_arm_hp_template, demangle_class_name, demangle_fund_type, do_type, do_arg, demangle_args, and demangle_nested_args. This can occur during execution of nm-new.\n    "
