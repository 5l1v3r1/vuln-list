  "details": [
    "\nIn Docker through 18.06.1-ce-rc2, the API endpoints behind the 'docker cp' command are vulnerable to a symlink-exchange attack with Directory Traversal, giving attackers arbitrary read-write access to the host filesystem with root privileges, because daemon/archive.go does not do archive operations on a frozen filesystem (or from within a chroot).\n    ",
    "\nIt was discovered that the API endpoint behind the 'docker cp' command is vulnerable to a Time Of Check to Time Of Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability in the way it handles symbolic links inside a container. An attacker who has compromised an existing container can cause arbitrary files on the host filesystem to be read/written when an administrator tries to copy a file from/to the container.\n    "
