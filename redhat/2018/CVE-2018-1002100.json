    "\nIn Kubernetes versions 1.5.x, 1.6.x, 1.7.x, 1.8.x, and prior to version 1.9.6, the kubectl cp command insecurely handles tar data returned from the container, and can be caused to overwrite arbitrary local files.\n    ",
    "\nAn improper validation flaw exists in the kubernetes 'kubectl cp' command. An attacker who could trick a user into using the command to copy files locally, from a pod, could override files outside of the target directory of the command.\n    "
