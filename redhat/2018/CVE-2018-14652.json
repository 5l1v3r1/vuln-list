    "\nThe Gluster file system through versions 3.12 and 4.1.4 is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the 'features/index' translator via the code handling the 'GF_XATTR_CLRLK_CMD' xattr in the 'pl_getxattr' function. A remote authenticated attacker could exploit this on a mounted volume to cause a denial of service.\n    ",
    "\nA buffer overflow was found in strncpy of the pl_getxattr() function. An authenticated attacker could remotely overflow the buffer by sending a buffer of larger length than the size of the key resulting in remote denial of service.\n    "
