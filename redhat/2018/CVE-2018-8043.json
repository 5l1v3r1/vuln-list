    "\nThe unimac_mdio_probe function in drivers/net/phy/mdio-bcm-unimac.c in the Linux kernel through 4.15.8 does not validate certain resource availability, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference).\n    ",
    "\nThe Linux kernel was found vulnerable to a NULL pointer dereference in the drivers/net/phy/mdio-bcm-unimac.c:unimac_mdio_probe() function caused by an unchecked return value from the platform_get_resource() function. A successful flaw exploitation can cause a system panic and a denial of service. This flaw is believed not to be an attacker triggerable as bad return value can be caused by hardware misconfiguration.\n    "
