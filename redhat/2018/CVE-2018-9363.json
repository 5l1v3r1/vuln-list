    "\nIn the hidp_process_report in bluetooth, there is an integer overflow. This could lead to an out of bounds write with no additional execution privileges needed.

    "\nA buffer overflow due to a singed-unsigned comparsion was found in hidp_process_report() in the net/bluetooth/hidp/core.c in the Linux kernel. The buffer length is an unsigned int but gets cast to a signed int which in certain conditions can lead to a system panic and a denial-of-service.\n    "
