    "\nprocps-ng before version 3.3.15 is vulnerable to a denial of service in ps via mmap buffer overflow. Inbuilt protection in ps maps a guard page at the end of the overflowed buffer, ensuring that the impact of this flaw is limited to a crash (temporary denial of service).\n    ",
    "\nDue to incorrect accounting when decoding and escaping Unicode data in procfs, ps is vulnerable to overflowing an mmap()ed region when formatting the process list for display. Since ps maps a guard page at the end of the buffer, impact is limited to a crash.\n    "
