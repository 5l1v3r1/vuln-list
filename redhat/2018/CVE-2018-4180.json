    "\nIn macOS High Sierra before 10.13.5, an issue existed in CUPS. This issue was addressed with improved access restrictions.\n    ",
    "\nIt was discovered that CUPS allows non-root users to pass environment variables to CUPS backends. Affected backends use attacker-controlled environment variables without proper sanitization. A local attacker, who is part of one of the groups specified in the SystemGroups directive, could use the cupsctl binary to set SetEnv and PassEnv directives and potentially controls the flow of the affected backend, resulting in some cases in arbitrary code execution with root privileges.\n    "
