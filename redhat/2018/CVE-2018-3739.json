    "\nhttps-proxy-agent before 2.1.1 passes auth option to the Buffer constructor without proper sanitization, resulting in DoS and uninitialized memory leak in setups where an attacker could submit typed input to the 'auth' parameter (e.g. JSON).\n    ",
    "\nA flaw was found in https-proxy-agent, prior to version 2.2.0. It was discovered https-proxy-agent passes an auth option to the Buffer constructor without proper sanitization. This could result in a Denial of Service through the usage of all available CPU resources and data exposure through an uninitialized memory leak in setups where an attacker could submit typed input to the auth parameter.\n    "
