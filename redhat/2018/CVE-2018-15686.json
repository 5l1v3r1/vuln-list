    "\nA vulnerability in unit_deserialize of systemd allows an attacker to supply arbitrary state across systemd re-execution via NotifyAccess. This can be used to improperly influence systemd execution and possibly lead to root privilege escalation. Affected releases are systemd versions up to and including 239.\n    ",
    "\nIt was discovered that systemd is vulnerable to a state injection attack when deserializing the state of a service. Properties longer than LINE_MAX are not correctly parsed and an attacker may abuse this flaw in particularly configured services to inject, change, or corrupt the service state.\n    "
