  "statement": "\nThis vulnerability affects libssh shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras. No libssh packages are included in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and earlier. This issue does not affect libssh2 or openssh.\n\nThis issue can only be affect applications that use libssh to implement an SSH server; SSH client functionality is not affected. No packages in Red Hat products use libssh to implement an SSH server. Therefore, no package from Red Hat that uses the libssh library is affected by this flaw.\n\nThe libssh library is available for customer or third party code to use. Such code that is linked against libssh and uses the `ssh_bind*` functions may be affected by this flaw.\n    ",
