    "\nAn issue was discovered in cp-demangle.c in GNU libiberty, as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.31. There is a stack consumption vulnerability resulting from infinite recursion in the functions next_is_type_qual() and cplus_demangle_type() in cp-demangle.c. Remote attackers could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service via an ELF file, as demonstrated by nm.\n    "
