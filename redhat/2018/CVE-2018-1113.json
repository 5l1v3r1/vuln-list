  "statement": "\nPreventing a user from accessing the system without deleting their account is not a simple matter. For utmost security, the account should be deleted. Short of this, we recommend a three-pronged approach:\n * change the user's login shell to a harmless command that is not in \"/etc/shells\" (for example \"/bin/false\") to prevent commands being run on their behalf\n * lock the user's password with \"usermod -L\" to prevent authentication with pam services\n * prevent access to the user's home directory with \"chmod 0\" or \"chown root\" and \"chmod 700\" to prevent authentication with ssh keys etc\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 5: \nThis vulnerability has been rated as having a security impact of Low. After evaluation and in accordance with the criteria noted in the product support life cycle, there are no plans to address this issue in an upcoming release. Please contact Red Hat Support for further information.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 6: \nThis vulnerability is currently targeted to be addressed in an upcoming release.\n    ",
