  "statement": "\nHTTP/2 support was added to haproxy in version 1.8, therefore OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 3.7 and earlier are unaffected by this flaw. OCP 3.11 added a configuration option to ose-haproxy-router that made enabling HTTP/2 support easy, [2]. Prior to that, in versions OCP 3.9 and 3.10, an administrator had to customize the haproxy router configuration to add HTTP/2 support, [3]. OCP 3.9, and 3.10 are rated as moderate because HTTP/2 support was not a standard configuration option, and therefore unlikely to be enabled.\n\nVersions of haproxy included in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7, excluding rh-haproxy18-haproxy in Red Hat Software Collections, are unaffected as they package versions of haproxy before 1.7.\n\n[1] http://www.haproxy.org/news.html\n[2] https://github.com/openshift/origin/pull/19968\n[3] https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.10/install_config/router/customized_haproxy_router.html\n    ",
