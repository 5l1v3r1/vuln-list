  "details": [
    "\nIn Perl through 5.26.2, the Archive::Tar module allows remote attackers to bypass a directory-traversal protection mechanism, and overwrite arbitrary files, via an archive file containing a symlink and a regular file with the same name.\n    ",
    "\nIt was found that the Archive::Tar module did not properly sanitize symbolic links when extracting tar archives. An attacker, able to provide a specially crafted archive for processing, could use this flaw to write or overwrite arbitrary files in the context of the Perl interpreter.\n    "
