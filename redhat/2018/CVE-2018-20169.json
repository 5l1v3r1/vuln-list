    "\nAn issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 4.19.9. The USB subsystem mishandles size checks during the reading of an extra descriptor, related to __usb_get_extra_descriptor in drivers/usb/core/usb.c.\n    ",
    "\nA flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel's USB subsystem in the __usb_get_extra_descriptor() function in the drivers/usb/core/usb.c which mishandles a size check during the reading of an extra descriptor data. By using a specially crafted USB device which sends a forged extra descriptor, an unprivileged user with physical access to the system can potentially cause a  privilege escalation or trigger a system crash or lock up and thus to cause a denial of service (DoS).\n    "
