    "\nA flaw was found In the Linux kernel, through version 4.19.6, where a local user could exploit a use-after-free in the ALSA driver by supplying a malicious USB Sound device (with zero interfaces) that is mishandled in usb_audio_probe in sound/usb/card.c.  An attacker could corrupt memory and possibly escalate privileges if the attacker is able to have physical access to the system.\n    "
