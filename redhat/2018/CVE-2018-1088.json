Use TLS certificates between gluster server nodes and clients.  \n\nCaveat: This would only mitigate attacks from unauthorized malicious clients. gluster clients allowed by auth.allow or having signed TLS client certificates would still be able to trigger this attack.\n    ",

Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization supports volume snapshot scheduling from the Web UI, which uses a distinct mechanism that is not subject to this vulnerability. VM snapshots are not impacted by this flaw. For more information, please see the Vulnerability Article linked under External References.\n\nThis issue did not affect the versions of glusterfs as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, and 7 because only gluster client is shipped in these products. CVE-2018-1088 affects glusterfs-server package as shipped with Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.\n    ",
