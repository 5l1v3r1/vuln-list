  "details": [
    "\n\"managed-keys\" is a feature which allows a BIND resolver to automatically maintain the keys used by trust anchors which operators configure for use in DNSSEC validation. Due to an error in the managed-keys feature it is possible for a BIND server which uses managed-keys to exit due to an assertion failure if, during key rollover, a trust anchor's keys are replaced with keys which use an unsupported algorithm. Versions affected: BIND 9.9.0 -\u003e 9.10.8-P1, 9.11.0 -\u003e 9.11.5-P1, 9.12.0 -\u003e 9.12.3-P1, and versions 9.9.3-S1 -\u003e 9.11.5-S3 of BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition. Versions 9.13.0 -\u003e 9.13.6 of the 9.13 development branch are also affected. Versions prior to BIND 9.9.0 have not been evaluated for vulnerability to CVE-2018-5745.\n    ",
    "\nAn assertion failure was found in the way bind implemented the \"managed keys\" feature. An attacker could use this flaw to cause the named daemon to crash. This flaw is very difficult for an attacker to trigger because it requires an operator to have BIND configured to use a trust anchor managed by the attacker.\n    "
