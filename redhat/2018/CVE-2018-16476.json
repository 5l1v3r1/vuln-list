    "\nA Broken Access Control vulnerability in Active Job versions \u003e= 4.2.0 allows an attacker to craft user input which can cause Active Job to deserialize it using GlobalId and give them access to information that they should not have. This vulnerability has been fixed in versions 4.2.11, 5.0.7.1, 5.1.6.1, and 5.2.1.1.\n    ",
    "\nA deserialization flaw, leading to an information exposure flaw, was found in the activejob component used by Red Hat CloudForms and Red Hat Satellite. An attacker can use this flaw to leak memory addresses belonging to the aforementioned applications.\n    "
