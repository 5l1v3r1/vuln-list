  "details": [
    "\nThe function hso_get_config_data in drivers/net/usb/hso.c in the Linux kernel through 4.19.8 reads if_num from the USB device (as a u8) and uses it to index a small array, resulting in an object out-of-bounds (OOB) read that potentially allows arbitrary read in the kernel address space.\n    ",
    "\nA flaw was found in the Linux kernel in the function hso_probe() which reads if_num value from the USB device (as an u8) and uses it without a length check to index an array, resulting in an OOB memory read in hso_probe() or hso_get_config_data(). An attacker with a forged USB device and physical access to a system (needed to connect such a device) can cause a system crash and a denial of service.\n    "
