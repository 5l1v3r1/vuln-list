    "\nAn issue was discovered in libX11 through 1.6.5. The function XListExtensions in ListExt.c interprets a variable as signed instead of unsigned, resulting in an out-of-bounds write (of up to 128 bytes), leading to DoS or remote code execution.\n    ",
    "\nAn out of bounds write, limited to NULL bytes, was discovered in libX11 in functions XListExtensions() and XGetFontPath(). The length field is considered as a signed value, which makes the library access memory before the intended buffer. An attacker who can either configure a malicious X server or modify the data coming from one could use this flaw to make the program crash or have other unspecified effects, caused by the memory corruption.\n    "
