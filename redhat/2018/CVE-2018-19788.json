For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/.\n\nThis issue affects the versions of polkit as shipped with Red Hat Virtualization 4. System users beyond those created at installation time are typically not used in Red Hat Virtualization Hypervisor or Management Appliance hosts, nor is there any opportunity to accidentally or maliciously create a user with a dangerous uid/gid on these systems under normal operation. For Red Hat Virtualization, this vulnerability has been rated as having a security impact of Low. Future updates may address this issue.\n    ",
