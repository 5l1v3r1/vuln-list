  "name": "CVE-2014-8133",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "\narch/x86/kernel/tls.c in the Thread Local Storage (TLS) implementation in the Linux kernel through 3.18.1 allows local users to bypass the espfix protection mechanism, and consequently makes it easier for local users to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism, via a crafted application that makes a set_thread_area system call and later reads a 16-bit value.\n    ",
    "\nIt was found that the espfix functionality could be bypassed by installing a 16-bit RW data segment into GDT instead of LDT (which espfix checks), and using that segment on the stack. A local, unprivileged user could potentially use this flaw to leak kernel stack addresses.\n    "
