    "\nThe curl_easy_duphandle function in libcurl 7.17.1 through 7.38.0, when running with the CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS option, does not properly copy HTTP POST data for an easy handle, which triggers an out-of-bounds read that allows remote web servers to read sensitive memory information.\n    ",
    "\nA flaw was found in the way the libcurl library performed the duplication of connection handles. If an application set the CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS option for a handle, using the handle's duplicate could cause the application to crash or disclose a portion of its memory.\n    "
