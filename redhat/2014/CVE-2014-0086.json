    "\nThe doFilter function in webapp/PushHandlerFilter.java in JBoss RichFaces 4.3.4, 4.3.5, and 5.x allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption and out-of-memory error) via a large number of malformed atmosphere push requests.\n    ",
    "\nIt was found that certain malformed requests caused RichFaces to leak memory. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to send a large number of malformed requests to a RichFaces application that uses the Atmosphere framework, leading to a denial of service (excessive memory consumption) on the application server.\n    "
