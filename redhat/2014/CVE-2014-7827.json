    "\nThe org.jboss.security.plugins.mapping.JBossMappingManager implementation in JBoss Security in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP) before 6.3.3 uses the default security domain when a security domain is undefined, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging credentials on the default domain for a role that is also on the application domain.\n    ",
    "\nIt was found that when processing undefined security domains, the org.jboss.security.plugins.mapping.JBossMappingManager implementation would fall back to the default security domain if it was available. A user with valid credentials in the defined default domain, with a role that is valid in the expected application domain, could perform actions that were otherwise not available to them. When using the SAML2 STS Login Module, JBossMappingManager exposed this issue due to the PicketLink Trust SecurityActions implementation using a hardcoded default value when defining the context.\n    "
