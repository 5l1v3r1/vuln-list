    "\nMIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) through 1.13.1 incorrectly expects that a krb5_read_message data field is represented as a string ending with a '\\0' character, which allows remote attackers to (1) cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) via a zero-byte version string or (2) cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) by omitting the '\\0' character, related to appl/user_user/server.c and lib/krb5/krb/recvauth.c.\n    ",
    "\nIt was found that the krb5_read_message() function of MIT Kerberos did not correctly sanitize input, and could create invalid krb5_data objects. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to crash a Kerberos child process via a specially crafted request.\n    "
