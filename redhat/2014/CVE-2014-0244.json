    "\nA denial of service flaw was found in the way the sys_recvfile() function of nmbd, the NetBIOS message block daemon, processed non-blocking sockets. An attacker could send a specially crafted packet that, when processed, would cause nmbd to enter an infinite loop and consume an excessive amount of CPU time.\n    "
