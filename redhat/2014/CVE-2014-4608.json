  "statement": "\nThis issue does not affect the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2 only support 64-bit architectures. Since exploiting this issue on 64-bit platforms is not feasible given the amount of input data that is necessary to trigger the integer overflow, we are currently not planning planning to fix this issue in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise MRG 2 (realtime-kernel):\nThis vulnerability has been rated as having a security impact of Low. After evaluation and in accordance with the criteria noted in the product support life cycle, there are no plans to address this issue in an upcoming release. Please contact Red Hat Support for further information.\n    ",

    "\n** DISPUTED ** Multiple integer overflows in the lzo1x_decompress_safe function in lib/lzo/lzo1x_decompress_safe.c in the LZO decompressor in the Linux kernel before 3.15.2 allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via a crafted Literal Run.  NOTE: the author of the LZO algorithms says \"the Linux kernel is *not* affected; media hype.\"\n    ",
    "\nAn integer overflow flaw was found in the way the lzo1x_decompress_safe() function of the Linux kernel's LZO implementation processed Literal Runs. A local attacker could, in extremely rare cases, use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.\n    "
