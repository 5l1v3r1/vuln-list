    "\nOpenStack PackStack 2012.2.1, when the Open vSwitch (OVS) monolithic plug-in is not used, does not properly set the libvirt_vif_driver configuration option when generating the nova.conf configuration, which causes the firewall to be disabled and allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.\n    ",
    "\nIt was discovered that the nova.conf configuration generated by PackStack did not correctly set the libvirt_vif_driver configuration option if the Open vSwitch (OVS) monolithic plug-in was not used. This could result in deployments defaulting to having the firewall disabled unless the nova configuration was manually modified after PackStack was started.\n    "
