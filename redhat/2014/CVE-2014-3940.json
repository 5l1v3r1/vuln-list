    "\nThe Linux kernel through 3.14.5 does not properly consider the presence of hugetlb entries, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or system crash) by accessing certain memory locations, as demonstrated by triggering a race condition via numa_maps read operations during hugepage migration, related to fs/proc/task_mmu.c and mm/mempolicy.c.\n    ",
    "\nA flaw was found in the way Linux kernel's Transparent Huge Pages (THP) implementation handled non-huge page migration. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the kernel by migrating transparent hugepages.\n    "
