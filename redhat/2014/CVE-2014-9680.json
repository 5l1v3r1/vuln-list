    "\nsudo before 1.8.12 does not ensure that the TZ environment variable is associated with a zoneinfo file, which allows local users to open arbitrary files for read access (but not view file contents) by running a program within an sudo session, as demonstrated by interfering with terminal output, discarding kernel-log messages, or repositioning tape drives.\n    ",
    "\nIt was discovered that sudo did not perform any checks of the TZ environment variable value. If sudo was configured to preserve the TZ environment variable, a local user with privileges to execute commands via sudo could possibly use this flaw to achieve system state changes not permitted by the configured commands.\n\nNote: The default sudoers configuration in Red Hat Enterprise Linux removes the TZ variable from the environment in which commands run by sudo are executed.\n    "
