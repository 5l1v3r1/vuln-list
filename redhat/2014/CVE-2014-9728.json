    "\nThe UDF filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.18.2 does not validate certain lengths, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (buffer over-read and system crash) via a crafted filesystem image, related to fs/udf/inode.c and fs/udf/symlink.c.\n    ",
    "\nA symlink size validation was missing in Linux kernels built with UDF file system (CONFIG_UDF_FS) support, allowing the corruption of kernel memory. An attacker able to mount a corrupted/malicious UDF file system image could cause the kernel to crash.\n    "
