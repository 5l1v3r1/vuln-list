    "\nThe Btrfs implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.19 does not ensure that the visible xattr state is consistent with a requested replacement, which allows local users to bypass intended ACL settings and gain privileges via standard filesystem operations (1) during an xattr-replacement time window, related to a race condition, or (2) after an xattr-replacement attempt that fails because the data does not fit.\n    "
