In addition, a configuration file can be placed in the classpath and will override both the system wide properties and Castor-default configuration.\" [1]\n\nAdding the following content in any of the above mentioned configuration files will act as a viable mitigation against this flaw. \n\n\u003e org.exolab.castor.sax.features=\\\n\u003e   http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl\n\u003e \n\u003e org.exolab.castor.sax.features-to-disable=\\\n\u003e   http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities,\\\n\u003e   http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities,\\\n\u003e   http://apache.org/xml/features/nonvalidating/load-external-dtd\n\nNote that using this configuration after upgrading to a version of Castor containing a fix for this issue might override any future hardening or changes to default behavior.\n\n[1] http://castor.codehaus.org/conf-lib.html\n    ",
