    "\nAn integer overflow flaw was found in the way the lzo library decompressed certain archives compressed with the LZO algorithm. An attacker could create a specially crafted LZO-compressed input that, when decompressed by an application using the lzo library, would cause that application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code.\n    "
