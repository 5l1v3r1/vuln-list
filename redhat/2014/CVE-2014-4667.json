    "\nThe sctp_association_free function in net/sctp/associola.c in the Linux kernel before 3.15.2 does not properly manage a certain backlog value, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (socket outage) via a crafted SCTP packet.\n    ",
    "\nAn integer underflow flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation processed certain COOKIE_ECHO packets. By sending a specially crafted SCTP packet, a remote attacker could use this flaw to prevent legitimate connections to a particular SCTP server socket to be made.\n    "
