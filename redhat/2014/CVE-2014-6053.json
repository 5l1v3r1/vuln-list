    "\nThe rfbProcessClientNormalMessage function in libvncserver/rfbserver.c in LibVNCServer 0.9.9 and earlier does not properly handle attempts to send a large amount of ClientCutText data, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption or daemon crash) via a crafted message that is processed by using a single unchecked malloc.\n    ",
