    "\nCertificates.java in Not Yet Commons SSL before 0.3.15 does not properly verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) field of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.\n    ",
    "\nIt was discovered that the implementation used by the Not Yet Commons SSL project to check that the server hostname matches the domain name in the subject's CN field was flawed. This could be exploited by a man-in-the-middle attacker by spoofing a valid certificate using a specially crafted subject.\n    "
