    "\nThe Linux kernel before 3.15.4 on Intel processors does not properly restrict use of a non-canonical value for the saved RIP address in the case of a system call that does not use IRET, which allows local users to leverage a race condition and gain privileges, or cause a denial of service (double fault), via a crafted application that makes ptrace and fork system calls.\n    ",
    "\nIt was found that the Linux kernel's ptrace subsystem allowed a traced process' instruction pointer to be set to a non-canonical memory address without forcing the non-sysret code path when returning to user space. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the system.\n\nNote: The CVE-2014-4699 issue only affected systems using an Intel CPU.\n    "
