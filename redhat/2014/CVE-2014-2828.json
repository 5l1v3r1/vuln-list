    "\nThe V3 API in OpenStack Identity (Keystone) 2013.1 before 2013.2.4 and icehouse before icehouse-rc2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a large number of the same authentication method in a request, aka \"authentication chaining.\"\n    ",
    "\nA flaw was found in the keystone V3 API. An attacker could send a single request with the same authentication method multiple times, possibly leading to a denial of service due to generating excessive load with minimal requests. Only keystone setups with the V3 API enabled were affected by this issue.\n    "
