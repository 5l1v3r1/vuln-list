    "\nThe UDF filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.18.2 does not ensure that space is available for storing a symlink target's name along with a trailing \\0 character, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information via a crafted filesystem image, related to fs/udf/symlink.c and fs/udf/unicode.c.\n    ",
