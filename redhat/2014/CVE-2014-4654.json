    "\nThe snd_ctl_elem_add function in sound/core/control.c in the ALSA control implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.15.2 does not check authorization for SNDRV_CTL_IOCTL_ELEM_REPLACE commands, which allows local users to remove kernel controls and cause a denial of service (use-after-free and system crash) by leveraging /dev/snd/controlCX access for an ioctl call.\n    ",
    "\nA use-after-free flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) implementation handled user controls. A local, privileged user could use this flaw to crash the system.\n    "
