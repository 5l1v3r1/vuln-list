    "\nIt was discovered that HornetQ REST did not set the resteasy.document.expand.entity.references context parameter to false by default. A HornetQ REST application, which does not explicitly set the required context parameter to false, may be vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. A remote attacker able to send XML requests to a HornetQ REST endpoint could use this flaw to read files accessible to the user running the application server, and potentially perform other more advanced XXE attacks.\n    "
