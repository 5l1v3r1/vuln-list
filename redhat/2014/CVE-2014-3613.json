  "details": [
    "\ncURL and libcurl before 7.38.0 does not properly handle IP addresses in cookie domain names, which allows remote attackers to set cookies for or send arbitrary cookies to certain sites, as demonstrated by a site at 192.168.0.1 setting cookies for a site at 127.168.0.1.\n    ",
    "\nIt was found that the libcurl library did not correctly handle partial literal IP addresses when parsing received HTTP cookies. An attacker able to trick a user into connecting to a malicious server could use this flaw to set the user's cookie to a crafted domain, making other cookie-related issues easier to exploit.\n    "
