    "\nIt was found that the libcurl library did not correctly handle partial literal IP addresses when parsing received HTTP cookies. An attacker able to trick a user into connecting to a malicious server could use this flaw to set the user's cookie to a crafted domain, making other cookie-related issues easier to exploit.\n    "
